2
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:28,203
My dad was a farmer.

3
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:32,270
Like everybody else back then.

4
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,125
Of course he didn't start that way.

5
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:43,607
Your computer says you're too tight.

6
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:46,568
No, I got this!
- Crossing the Straits.

7
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,226
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
- Heyyy.

8
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:55,279
Shutting it all down...
- Hey, don't turn it off!

9
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,339
Dad?

10
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,747
Sorry Murph. Go back to bed babe.

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,458
I thought you were the ghost.

12
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:18,082
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
- Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

13
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:21,854
No, that's because
grandpa is too close to...

14
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,530
...being one himself. Go back to bed.

15
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,577
Were you dreaming about the crash?

16
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,465
Get your butt back in bed Murph.

17
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,068
The wheat had died.

18
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:03,224
The blight came and we had to burn it.
But We still had corn.

19
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:08,141
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,317
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

21
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:17,801
Just that, steady blow of dirt.

22
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,245
We wore little strips of sheet...

23
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:27,312
...sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

24
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,216
Well when we set the table we always
set the plate upside down.

25
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,938
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside down.

26
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:45,570
Shake a leg. Murph, get a move on.
- One o'clock today, you and me...

27
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,146
...in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101, check?
- Yessir.

28
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:52,059
Not at the table Murph!

29
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,761
Dad, can you fix this?

30
00:02:56,164 --> 00:02:59,189
What the heck did you do to my lander?
- It wasn't me.

31
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:02,945
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
- It knocked it off my shelf.

32
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,753
It also knocks the books off.
- There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

33
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,030
Hey.
- I looked it up, it's called a poltergeist.

34
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,740
Dad, tell her.
- Well, that's not very scientific Murph.

35
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:15,637
You said that science was about admitting what we don't know.
- She's got you there.

36
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,841
Hey, start looking after all our stuff.

37
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,580
Coop.

38
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,373
Alright Murph, you wanna talk science?

39
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:29,846
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you gotta go further.

40
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,079
You have to record the facts, analyze...

41
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:36,391
...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions.
Deal?

42
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,765
Deal.
- All right!

43
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:43,292
Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

44
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:47,636
Parent-Teacher conferences,
parent, not grandparent.

45
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,625
Slow down turbo.
That's not a dust storm.

46
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,708
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
- Blight?

47
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:02,364
They're saying it's the last harvest for okra.
Ever.

48
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:09,147
He should have planted corn like the rest of us.
- Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.

49
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,603
She's single.
- Well what's that supposed to mean?

50
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,977
Repopulating the Earth.
- Start pulling your weight young man.

51
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:19,176
Why don't you start minding
your own business? Old man!

52
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:27,767
All right Murph give me second.

53
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:32,771
Aha,.... thirrrd.

54
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:37,707
Find a gear dumbass.
- Grind it! -Shut it Tom!

55
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,504
Whatcha do Murph?
- Ahh, she didn't do nothing.

56
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:45,172
Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.
- Shut up!

57
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:48,076
Grab the spare Tom.
- That is the spare.

58
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:51,278
Get the patch kit.

59
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:54,895
And how am I supposed to patch it out here?

60
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:58,372
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always
gonna be here to help you.

61
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:08,767
What's goin' on Murph?

62
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:13,567
Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad?
- No we didn't?

63
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,473
Murphy's Law?

64
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,721
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...

65
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,637
...will happen.
What it means is whatever can happen...

66
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:26,346
...will happen.
And that sounded just fine with us.

67
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,131
Get in.

68
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:36,838
Get in, let's go.

69
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:40,701
What about the flat tire?

70
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:44,223
Yes.

71
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:03,208
It is an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,221
Take the wheel Tom.

73
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:12,366
Go, go go!

74
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,075
Keep it pointed at that.

75
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:25,007
Faster Tom, we're losing it.
- Yes.

76
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,956
Point right at it.

77
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,361
Hang on, here we go, here we go.

78
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,405
Nice driving Tom.

79
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,280
Dad?
- Almost got it, don't stop, don't stop.

80
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,332
Dad?!
Tom!

81
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:03,092
Wha..? You told me to keep driving.

82
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,566
Well I guess that answers the ol'
'if I ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.

83
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:14,662
We lost it.
- No we didn't!

84
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,010
Wanna give it a whirl?

85
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,391

86
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,971

87
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,400
Let's land it down there,
right at the edge of the reservoir.

88
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,082
Nicely done!

89
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,975
How long do you think it's been up there?

90
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,925
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours, 10 years ago.

91
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,701
So for 10 years?

92
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,354
Why'd it come down so low?
- I don't know.

93
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:14,604
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.
- What?

94
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:18,150
Give me that large flatblade
Maybe some kind of signal.

95
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:19,441
I don't know.

96
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,073
What are you gonna do with it?

97
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:30,009
I'm gonna give it something socially
responsible to do...

98
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:34,574
...like driving a combine.
- Can't we just, let it go?

99
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,027
It wasn't hurting anybody.

100
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:44,172
Listen, this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph,
like the rest of us.

101
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:51,989
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
- I've got class.

102
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,554
This one, needs to wait.

103
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:58,782
What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it when you get in there.

104
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,353
Well am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

105
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:02,756
Just please, try not to.

106
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:06,766
Hey, relax.... I got this.

107
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:14,647
A little late Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

108
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:18,684
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

109
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:22,034
No actually sir, that's a, that's
a surveillance drone.

110
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,947
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
- Take a seat.

111
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:32,241
So, we got Tom's scores back.

112
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:37,074
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
- Yeah he's got a knack for it.

113
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,448
What about college?

114
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:42,808
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

115
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,800
- I still pay my taxes.
Where does that money go? There's no more armies.

116
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,802
Well, it don't go to the university.

117
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,655
Look Coop, you have to be realistic.

118
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:57,133
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

119
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,788
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
- What's your waistline?

120
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,650
How about 32, about 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

121
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,896
You're telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass...

122
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,348
...but only one to measure my son's future?

123
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,058
Come on, you're a well-educated man Coop...

124
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,407
...and a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

125
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:22,264
Okay well right now, we don't need more engineers.

126
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:27,341
We didn't run out of television screens or planes;
we ran out of food!

127
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:31,813
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers like you, and Tom.

128
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:36,652
Uneducated farmers.
- We are a caretaker generation Coop.

129
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,473
And things are getting better.
Maybe your grandkids will get to be...

130
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,196
- Are we done here sir?

131
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:46,678
No.
Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.

132
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:51,655
Murph is a great kid, she's really bright.
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

133
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:56,100
She brought this in to show the other students.
The section on the lunar landings.

134
00:10:56,176 --> 00:11:00,631
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

135
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:04,633
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

136
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,477
Corrected?
- Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...

137
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:10,669
...the Soviet Union.

138
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,187
You don't believe we went to the Moon?

139
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:23,693
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda
that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...

140
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:27,328
...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.

141
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,876
Useless machines?

142
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:32,864
And if we don't want a repeat of the
excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...

143
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,721
...then we need to teach our kids about this planet.
Not tales of leaving it.

144
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,421
Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make
was called an MRI.

145
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:45,033
And if we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

146
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:49,064
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died; instead of afterwards.

147
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:52,837
And then she would have been the one sitting here
listening to this instead of me...

148
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:57,604
...which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

149
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,851
I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.

150
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,404
But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...

151
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,809
...over this Apollo nonsense.

152
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:10,955
So we thought it would be best to bring you in
and see what ideas you might have...

153
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,765
...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.

154
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:17,536
Yeah, you know what,
there's a game tomorrow night.

155
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:21,419
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase,
her favorite team is playing.

156
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,089
There's gonna be candy and soda...

157
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,976
...I think I'll take her to that.

158
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:37,980
How'd it go?
- I got you suspended.

159
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,247
What?
- Cooper.

160
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:45,925
This is Cooper, go.
- Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.

161
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:50,651
Just reset the controllers.
- I did that, but you should come take a look.

162
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:13,758
One by one they just tailed off the fields
and headed over.

163
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,573
Something's interfering with the compass.

164
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:20,134
Magnetism. Or somethin' such.

165
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,003
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

166
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:10,344
I counted the spaces.
- Why?

167
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:16,834
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

168
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:21,624
Morse?
- Yeah, dots and dashes. It's...

169
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:24,020
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

170
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,222
...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.

171
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:42,104
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset the anomaly.

172
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,015
Which is?
- I don't know.

173
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,850
Now if the house had been built
on magnetic ore...

174
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,730
...we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

175
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:57,694
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

176
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:04,182
You heard?
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.

177
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:09,145
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

178
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,882
When I was a kid, it felt like
they made something new everyday.

179
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,121
Some gadget or idea.

180
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:23,875
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6, billion people,

181
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,864
Just try to imagine that.

182
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:30,219
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

183
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,178
This world isn't so bad.

184
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:41,548
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

185
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:44,318
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

186
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,779
My daughter knew it. God bless her.

187
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,664
And your kids know it,
especially Murph.

188
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:55,086
Ahh we used to look up at the sky and wonder...

189
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,483
...at our place in the stars.

190
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,774
Now we just look down,

191
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:05,847
and worry about our place in the dirt.

192
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,397
Cooper, you were good at something,

193
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:12,071
and you never got a chance to do anything with it.

194
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,906
I'm sorry.

195
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:19,320
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

196
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:23,222
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

197
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:28,212
In April I believe if I'm right,
15th of April I, I think.

198
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:32,671
This just happened at about 1:30 when that thing
came off the top of the canyon.

199
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:38,025
In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?

200
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,835
Well in my day, people were too busy...

201
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:43,247
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

202
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:48,149
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

203
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,567
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.

204
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:54,679
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

205
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:58,570
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

206
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:03,320
Grandpa said huh?
Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.

207
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:07,573
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

208
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,706
And you're gonna be great at it.

209
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,134
Let's get outta here.

210
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:36,138
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang, lets mask up.

211
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,255
Tom, Murph? -Check.
- Check?

212
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:37,198
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

213
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,543
Murph.

214
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,117
The ghost.
- Grab your pillow.

215
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:10,570
You're sleeping with Tom.

216
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:07,336
It's not a ghost.

217
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,990
It's gravity.

218
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,483
I'm dropping Tom, then heading into town.

219
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:22,917
You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.

220
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,917
It's not Morse Murph, it's binary.

221
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:53,441
Thick is 1, thin is 0.

222
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:58,734
Coordinates.

223
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:16,911
That's it.
- I can't miss this.

224
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,572
Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.

225
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:22,627
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

226
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:28,542
And that, is why I can't take you.

227
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:35,671
Murph?

228
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,081
Grandpa will be home in a while, tell
him I'll call him on the radio.

229
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:51,195
Jesus!
What're you doing?

230
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:53,909
Oh d'you think it's funny? Huh?

231
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,814
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

232
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:01,231
Make yourself useful.

233
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,253
Hey Murph.

234
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,952
Murph.

235
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,857
I think this is the end of the road.

236
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,357
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

237
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,604
That's my girl.

238
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,617
Step away from the fence.
- Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

239
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:53,981
My daughter is in the car.

240
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:01,223
Don't be afraid.

241
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:18,150
How did you find this place?
- Where is my daughter?

242
00:24:18,264 --> 00:24:22,518
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
Where did you get those coordinates?

243
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:26,378
Where is my daughter?!
- Don't make me take you down again, sit down!

244
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:29,434
Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?

245
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,848
Marines don't exist. And you know what?

246
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:35,662
I've got grunts like you mowing my grass.

247
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:39,848
Where did you find those coordinates?
- Unless you wanna end up as my second lawnmower...

248
00:24:40,498 --> 00:24:44,721
...no, I think I'll turn you into a valve of a vacuum cleaner.
No you won't.

249
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,686
TARS, back down please.

250
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,018
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

251
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:57,202
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

252
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,219
It's what the government could spare.

253
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:03,815
Who are you?
- Dr. Brand.

254
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:08,785
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a Professor.
- What makes you think I'm not?

255
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:10,494
Wasn't near as cute either.

256
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,350
Please Dr. Brand, I don't have
any idea what this is.

257
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:17,629
But I'm scared for my daughter,
and I want her by my side.

258
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:20,228
You give me that, and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

259
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,797
Get the principals and the girl
to the conference room please.

260
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:30,849
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

261
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:35,461
Must have a very smart mother.
- It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

262
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:39,878
Why don't you let us back up from your fence
and we'll be on our way, huh?

263
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:42,801
It's not that simple.
- Well, sure it is.

264
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:45,899
Look I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

265
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,239
Yes you do.

266
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:55,003
Dad!

267
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,230
Hello Cooper.

268
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,718
Professor Brand.

269
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:05,684
Explain to me how you found this facility.

270
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:09,220
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

271
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:11,851
You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.

272
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:14,757
Nobody stumbles in here, nobody stumbles out.

273
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:19,698
Cooper, please, cooperate with these people.

274
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:24,013
Well, it's kinda hard to explain.

275
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:28,122
We we.., we learnt these coordinates...

276
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:30,763
...from an anomaly.
- What sort of anomaly?

277
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:34,699
I hesitate to term it supernatural
but it damn well wasn't scientific...

278
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:39,650
You're gonna have to be specific
Mr. Cooper, right now.
- It was gravity.

279
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,412
Um what sort of gravitational
an- where was this thing?

280
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:50,908
Hey, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity bud, but...

281
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:55,478
...you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.
- Assurances? -Yeah.

282
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,510
Like that we're getting out of here, and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

283
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:06,349
Don't you know who we are Coop?
- No Professor, I don't.

284
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:10,059
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

285
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:14,079
NASA?
- NASA.

286
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,744
The same NASA, you flew for.

287
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:30,530
I heard they shut you down sir,
for refusing to drop bombs from...

288
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:33,048
...the stratosphere on the starving people.

289
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,764
When they realized that killing other people...

290
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:40,299
...was not a long term solution,
then they needed us back. In secret.

291
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:44,930
Why secret?
- Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

292
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:47,765
Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.

293
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:53,159
Blight. Wheat, seven years ago.

294
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,434
Okra, this year.
- Now, there's just corn.

295
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:59,145
And we're growing more than we ever had.

296
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:03,605
Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

297
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:08,397
...the corn will die. Soon.

298
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:17,262
We'll find a way, Professor, we always have.

299
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:22,164
Driven by the unshakeable faith
that the Earth is ours?

300
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,296
Well not just ours, no.

301
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:26,824
But it is our home.

302
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:31,475
Earth's atmosphere is 80 % nitrogen.

303
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,515
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

304
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,241
Blight does, and as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

305
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,178
The last people to starve, will be the first to suffocate.

306
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:44,577
And your daughter's generation...

307
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:48,347
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

308
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:52,421
Murph is feeling a little tired, and was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office?

309
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,952
Yeah, thank you.

310
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,003
Okay.

311
00:28:58,147 --> 00:29:02,211
Now you need to tell me, what your plan is to save the world?

312
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:07,169
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

313
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:17,194
Rangers.
- The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.

314
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:21,105
The Endurance.
Our final expedition.

315
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:25,183
You sent people out there looking for a new home?

316
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,185
The Lazarus missions.
- Sounds cheerful!

317
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:32,552
Lazarus came back from the dead.
- Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

318
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:35,087
There's not a planet in our
solar system that could sustain...

319
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:38,569
...life and the nearest
star is over a 1000 years away.

320
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:40,703
I mean, it doesn't even qualify as futile.

321
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,135
Where did you send them?

322
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:50,004
Cooper, I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

323
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,514
You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

324
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:56,925
This team never left the simulator!

325
00:29:56,998 --> 00:30:00,460
We need a pilot, and this is
the mission that you were trained for.

326
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,544
What, without even knowing?

327
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,649
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive,
and you were going anyway.

328
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:11,785
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

329
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,393
They chose you.
- Who's 'They'?

330
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:26,213
How long, would I be gone?
- Hard to know.

331
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,232
Years.
- I've got kids Professor.

332
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:33,505
Get out there, and save them.

333
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:40,190
Who's 'They'?
- We started detecting gravitational anomalies,

334
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,044
almost 50 years ago.

335
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,727
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

336
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,004
In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.

337
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:51,411
Yeah, in the Straits.

338
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:55,694
My crash, something tripped my fly-by-wire.

339
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:02,628
Exactly. But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

340
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:06,692
Out near Saturn.
A disturbance of spacetime.

341
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:12,389
Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

342
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,597
And it leads, where?
- Another galaxy.

343
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:21,060
A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.

344
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:23,702
Someone placed it there.
- 'They'?

345
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:28,934
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

346
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:32,179
That wormhole let's us
travel to other stars.

347
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:34,452
It came right around when we needed it.

348
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:37,688
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

349
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:41,701
Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
- You sent probes into that?

350
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:45,381
We sent people into it, 10 years ago.

351
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:48,044
The Lazarus missions.

352
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,784
12 possible worlds, 12 Ranger launches.

353
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,129
Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.

354
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:58,084
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

355
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,361
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

356
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:03,015
But they could use hibernation to stretch that...

357
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:07,120
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

358
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,529
Their mission was to assess their world and...

359
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:13,310
...if it showed potential, then they could send
out a signal and bed down for the long nap...

360
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,743
...wait to be rescued.
- And what if the world didn't show promise?

361
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:19,789
Hence the bravery.

362
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:24,120
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
- No.

363
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:28,039
Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.

364
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:31,030
Simple binary pings on an annual basis...

365
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:35,823
...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
One system shows promise.

366
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:38,192
Well one, that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?

367
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,796
One system with 3 potential worlds?

368
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:43,695
Not a long shot.

369
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:49,924
Wait.
So if we find a home...

370
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:56,889
...then what?
- That's the long shot.

371
00:32:57,047 --> 00:33:00,246
There is a plan A, and a plan B.

372
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:04,278
Did you notice anything
strange about the launch chamber?

373
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,465
This entire facility is a centrifuge.

374
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:23,591
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
- Both. The plan A.

375
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:25,214
How do you get it off the ground?

376
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:29,637
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

377
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:34,173
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity
was real.

378
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,196
So I started working on a theory and we started...

379
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,510
...building this station.
- But you haven't solved it yet.

380
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:44,350
That's why there's a plan B.

381
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:46,700
The problem is gravity.

382
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:49,689
How to get a viable amount of human life
off the planet?

383
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,871
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

384
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:58,217
Over 5000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

385
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:03,834
How would you raise 'em?
- With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.

386
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:07,615
After that, with surrogacy
the growth becomes exponential.

387
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:11,789
In 30 years, we could have
a colony of hundreds.

388
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:15,983
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

389
00:34:16,018 --> 00:34:17,154
This will take care of that.

390
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:22,047
Yeah, but what about the people here?
You just, you'd give up on 'em?

391
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:27,165
My kids?
- That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

392
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:32,747
How far have you got?
- Almost there.

393
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,768
You're asking me to hang everything...

394
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,387
...on an 'almost'.
- I'm asking you to trust me.

395
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:45,497
Find us a new home.

396
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:50,096
And by the time you return,
I would've solved the problem...

397
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,650
...of gravity.
I give you my word.

398
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,621
Go away!

399
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:22,697
Murph.
- Go. If you're leaving just go!

400
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:29,352
This world was never enough for you,
was it Cooper?

401
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:33,892
What, cause heading out there is what I feel like...
...I was born to do?

402
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,883
And it excites me?

403
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:40,352
Nah, it does not make it wrong.
- It might.

404
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:44,295
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

405
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:49,324
The 'why' of the thing, that's the foundation.
- And the foundation's solid.

406
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:55,208
We farmers, we sit here every year when...

407
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:59,171
...the rains fail, and we say:
Next year.

408
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,380
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.

409
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,198
This world's a treasure Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

410
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:16,721
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

411
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:24,387
Tom will be alright,
but you got to make things right with Murph.
- I will.

412
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:28,442
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.

413
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:40,889
You have to talk to me Murph.

414
00:36:42,397 --> 00:36:45,779
I need to fix this before I go.

415
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:48,408
Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.

416
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:55,513
After you kids came along, your mom, she
said something to me I never quite understood.

417
00:36:55,662 --> 00:37:00,407
She said: Now, we're just here...

418
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:03,572
...to be the memories for our kids.

419
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:11,170
I think I now understand what she meant.

420
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,794
Once you're a parent, you're the
ghost of your children's future.

421
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:22,700
You said ghosts didn't exist.

422
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,469
That's right Murph.

423
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:35,469
Look at me.

424
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:40,486
I can't be your ghost right now.

425
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:44,223
I need to exist.

426
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:48,249
They chose me.

427
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,282
Murph, they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

428
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,779
And that's exactly why you can't go!

429
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:05,819
I figured out the message.
One word. You know what it is?

430
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:08,530
Murph.
- STAY.

431
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,954
It says STAY dad.
- Murph.

432
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:16,868
You don't believe me!
Look at the books. Look it says STAY.

433
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:21,380
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
- I'm coming back.

434
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,610
When?

435
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:39,480
One for you.
One for me.

436
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,493
When I'm up there in hypersleep,

437
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:45,216
or, or traveling at the speed of light,

438
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,856
or, near a black hole,

439
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,306
Time is gonna change for me.

440
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,620
And it's gonna run more slowly.

441
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:56,742
So, when we get back,

442
00:38:56,927 --> 00:39:01,575
we're gonna compare.
- Time will run differently for us?

443
00:39:01,688 --> 00:39:02,518
Yeah.

444
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,769
Maybe by the time I get back,
you and I, we might be the same age.

445
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:09,436
You and me.
What?

446
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:11,024
Imagine that!

447
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:18,731
Ah, Murph.
- You've no idea when you're coming back!

448
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:24,003
No idea at all!
- Murph.

449
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:29,324
Murph, don't ma-, don't make me leave like this.
Murph!

450
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:32,100
Don't make me leave like this Murph!

451
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,882
Hey,... I love you, forever.

452
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:46,895
You hear me?
I love you forever.

453
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,407
And I'm coming back.

454
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:55,905
I'm coming back.

455
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:16,370
How did it go?
- Fine.

456
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:17,921
Just fine.

457
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,779
I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay?
- Yeah. Take care of our place for me alright?

458
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:34,146
Huh?
- Uh huh.

459
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:40,527
Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

460
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:44,090
I'll make sure they bring it back.

461
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,661
Look after my kids Donald.

462
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:04,282
Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.

463
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:08,993
Dad!
- 9 -Dad!

464
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:13,467
8, 7.
- DAD!

465
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:18,815
6, 5.
Main engines start.

466
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:27,781
4, 3, 2, 1. Booster ignition, and.

467
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:38,511
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

468
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:46,064
Prepare for stage one separation.

469
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:48,006
Stage one.

470
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:59,199
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

471
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,768
They gave him a humor setting,
to fit in better with his unit.

472
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:09,460
He thinks it relaxes us.
- A giant sarcastic robot!

473
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:14,791
What a great idea!
- I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?

474
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:16,025
That would probably help.

475
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:20,230
Yeah you could use it to find your way back into the ship
after I blow you out the air lock.

476
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:23,270
What's your humor setting TARS?

477
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,276
100 % -Let's bring it down to 75 please.

478
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:29,229
Stage two separation.

479
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,519
All feeds going manual.
- Going manual.

480
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:48,644
Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3.
- Check.

481
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:57,100
Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

482
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,683
ABF check. Over.

483
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:07,378
Retro thrusters fine, fuel cells 1, 2, 3.

484
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:11,049
100 %
ex-mites.

485
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,837
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

486
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:26,921
Your father.
- We're gonna be spending a lot of time together,

487
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:30,601
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

488
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:36,478
Just being honest.
- Well you don't need to be that honest.

489
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:41,010
Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
- 90 %

490
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,633
90 %?

491
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,273
Absolute honesty
isn't always the most diplomatic...

492
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:50,022
...nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.
- Okay!

493
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:52,478
90 % it is Dr. Brand.

494
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:59,532
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

495
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:18,605
Okay taking control.

496
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:24,836
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

497
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:39,655
It's all you Doyle.

498
00:44:57,023 --> 00:45:00,691
Nice and easy Doyle, nice and easy.

499
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:08,481
Take us home.

500
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,815
Target locked.

501
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:20,379
Target locked. -Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

502
00:45:20,535 --> 00:45:21,433
Good job.

503
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:57,799
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

504
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:24,342
Cooper, you should have control.
- Control here.

505
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:28,062
Communication with ring module active.

506
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:43,652
That's initiate.

507
00:46:51,213 --> 00:46:53,410
Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

508
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,410
Hello CASE.
- Hello TARS.

509
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:11,804
Okay, we're all set.
- All right let's do it.

510
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:43,048
30 % of spin.

511
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:50,466
One g.

512
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:55,227
How is gravity treating you back there?

513
00:47:58,173 --> 00:48:02,143
Romilly, hey you okay?
- Yeah. -You all right?

514
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,126
Yeah, no I just need a minute.

515
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,307
Okay, I think we have some dramamine
in the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that.

516
00:48:07,419 --> 00:48:10,690
It'll be in the cryo beds
Just be a sec. -Hey Brand?

517
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:12,321
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

518
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:24,439
Amelia, be safe.

519
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:28,720
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will Dad.

520
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:33,791
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated, two years to Saturn.

521
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:35,711
That's a lot of Dramamine.

522
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,880
Look after my family will you please, sir?

523
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:42,260
We'll be waiting for you, when you get back.

524
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:47,333
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

525
00:48:49,316 --> 00:48:52,771
'Do not go gentle into that good night,'

526
00:48:52,962 --> 00:48:57,664
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day,'

527
00:48:58,963 --> 00:49:03,567
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

528
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:08,809
'Though wise men at their end,
know dark is right.'

529
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:11,829
'Because their words had forked no lightning they'

530
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:15,384
'Do not go gentle, into that good night'

531
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:20,710
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

532
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:46,085
Here, pills.

533
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:53,028
So alone.
- We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

534
00:49:53,137 --> 00:49:54,436
I mean them.

535
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,050
It's a perfect planet and we're
not gonna find another one like it.

536
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:04,579
No, it's not like, looking for a new condo.

537
00:50:04,729 --> 00:50:08,803
The human race is going to be, adrift.

538
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:12,876
Desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

539
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:14,569
We need to find that rock,

540
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,698
and our 3 prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain human life.

541
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:24,902
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

542
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,395
Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

543
00:50:34,436 --> 00:50:36,844
Oh, um, Wolf's a particle physicist.

544
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:41,206
Any of them had families?

545
00:50:42,614 --> 00:50:45,515
No, no attachments. My father insisted.

546
00:50:45,704 --> 00:50:48,327
They'all knew the possibility of...

547
00:50:48,402 --> 00:50:51,330
...seeing another human being again.
I'm hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.

548
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,741
Dr. Mann?
- Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable. He's the best of us.

549
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:58,804
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

550
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,836
...in human history.

551
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:03,238
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.

552
00:51:03,382 --> 00:51:06,404
Y'know out there, we would face great odds.

553
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,745
Death. But, not evil.

554
00:51:10,892 --> 00:51:13,228
You don't think nature can be evil?

555
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:18,193
No. Formidable, frightening. But, no, not evil.

556
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:23,495
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

557
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,481
Just what we take with us then?

558
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,349
Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.

559
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:33,532
Even me, huh?
- Y'know what? We agreed, 90 %.

560
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:35,842
Don't stay up.

561
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:37,114
I'll be in a minute.

562
00:51:37,273 --> 00:51:41,418
Just remember Coop, you're literally wasting your breath.

563
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,962
Hey TARS, let's go over that trajectory one more time.

564
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:55,886
8 months to Mars.
Gravity powered slingshot around,

565
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,345
14 months to Saturn.
Nothing has changed on that.

566
00:51:58,493 --> 00:51:59,970
Let me ask you something.

567
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:05,692
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

568
00:52:07,568 --> 00:52:12,540
Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close?
- I wouldn't know.

569
00:52:12,728 --> 00:52:15,613
Is that '90 % wouldn't know' or '10 % wouldn't know'?

570
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,812
I also have a discretion setting Cooper.

571
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,177
But not a poker-face slick.

572
00:52:34,663 --> 00:52:35,961
Hey guys.

573
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:39,782
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

574
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:42,732
And I just, wanted to give you an update.

575
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:46,745
The Earth looks amazing from here.

576
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:51,035
You can't see any of the dust.

577
00:52:52,012 --> 00:52:55,432
I really hope you guys are doin', doin' great.

578
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:58,325
I know you're gonna get this message,

579
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:02,855
Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you.
Alright, okay I love you!

580
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:06,468
Is it him?
- I don't think so Murph.

581
00:53:13,058 --> 00:53:15,432
You must be Donald.

582
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:21,314
Hello Murph.
- Why are you in my dad's truck?

583
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:24,127
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

584
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:26,903
He sent you a message.

585
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,275
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

586
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:35,802
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

587
00:53:37,244 --> 00:53:44,303
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe, I should fan the flame.

588
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:48,979
She's already making fools of her teachers,
well, maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.

589
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:53,513
So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

590
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:58,014
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

591
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:41,376
They want me to repeat plant pathology.

592
00:54:41,523 --> 00:54:46,958
It sucks. But, they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

593
00:54:47,424 --> 00:54:50,883
So... alright.
Well, I gotta go Dad.

594
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,145
Hope you're safe up there.

595
00:54:55,333 --> 00:55:00,005
Sorry Coop, I asked Murph to say hi.

596
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,016
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

597
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:21,682
Are you alright Rom?

598
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:27,603
This gets to me Cooper.
This, this.

599
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:31,200
Millimeters of aluminum that's it
and then nothing...

600
00:55:31,346 --> 00:55:35,054
...out there for millions of miles, won't kill us in seconds.

601
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:41,048
Did you know that some of
the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...

602
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:45,741
...don't know how to swim?
They don't know, and if they go overboard, they're done.

603
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:49,578
We are explorers Rom.

604
00:55:50,918 --> 00:55:54,132
This is our boat.
Here.

605
00:56:21,163 --> 00:56:25,937
This is the, relay probe?
- In orbit around the wormhole.

606
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,566
This is the wormhole and every
time we come around...

607
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:32,416
...we would receive images from
the other side of the foreign galaxy.

608
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:36,015
Like swinging a periscope around.
- Exactly.

609
00:56:36,129 --> 00:56:40,030
So we got a pretty good idea,
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

610
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:42,982
Navigationally.

611
00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:47,705
Hey guys, looks like we're gonna be
approaching the wormhole in about three hours.

612
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:57,721
Hey Coop, can we stop the spinning?

613
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:01,790
Why? -Because we're close enough to see it now.

614
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:05,971
Alright.

615
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:14,403
Look, that's, that's it! That's the wormhole!

616
00:57:14,546 --> 00:57:17,473
Say it, don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

617
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:21,176
Well of course it is!
What you thought it would just be a hole?

618
00:57:22,226 --> 00:57:26,107
No. It's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen they...

619
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:30,117
The illustrations, try to show how it works.

620
00:57:30,235 --> 00:57:34,439
So they say you want to go from here, to there.

621
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:36,078
But this is too far.

622
00:57:36,261 --> 00:57:39,884
So a wormhole bends space like this so you...

623
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:43,507
...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.

624
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:48,412
Okay so, to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space...

625
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:52,785
...into 2 dimensions, which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

626
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:55,952
...a circle.
What's a circle in 3 dimensions?

627
00:57:57,147 --> 00:58:00,314
A sphere.
- Exactly. A spherical hole.

628
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:04,439
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

629
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,374
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get outta here in one piece Rom.

630
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:17,791
Any trick to this Doyle?

631
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:20,530
No one knows.

632
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:29,814
The others made it, right?

633
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:33,638
At least some of 'em.

634
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:08,491
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?

635
00:59:08,638 --> 00:59:11,223
To our galaxy.

636
00:59:12,779 --> 00:59:14,478
Here we go.

637
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:50,152
Controls won't work here.
We are passing through the bulk.

638
00:59:50,264 --> 00:59:55,090
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions.
All you can do is report and observe.

639
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:07,532
What is that?

640
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:13,597
I think it's 'Them'.
- Distorting spacetime?

641
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,279
Don't. Don't!

642
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,869
What was that?

643
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,378
First handshake.

644
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:53,322
We're...

645
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:55,737
We're here.

646
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:19,910
So the lost communications came through.
- How?

647
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:24,985
The relay on this side cached them.
It's years of basic data, no real surprises.

648
01:01:25,966 --> 01:01:30,480
Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up',
as has Dr. Mann's.

649
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:34,319
Edmunds' went down three years ago.
- Transmitter failure?

650
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:37,313
Maybe.
He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.

651
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:41,079
But Miller's still looks good though, right?
Because she's coming up fast.

652
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:43,428
With one complication.

653
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:47,577
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

654
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:50,775
Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

655
01:01:50,925 --> 01:01:52,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

656
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:56,194
And Miller's is on the horizon?
- Like a basketball around a hoop.

657
01:01:56,308 --> 01:01:58,915
Landing there takes us dangerously close...

658
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:02,185
...and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

659
01:02:04,298 --> 01:02:07,820
Look I-, I could swing around that neutron star to decelerate...

660
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:10,485
- No no no, it's not that, it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

661
01:02:10,632 --> 01:02:13,920
...slow our clock compared to Earth's,.. Drastically.

662
01:02:13,955 --> 01:02:15,683
Well how bad?

663
01:02:15,794 --> 01:02:22,596
Well, every hour we spend on that planet
will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth.

664
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:26,804
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

665
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:31,204
Well, we can't just drop down there without...
- Cooper...

666
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:33,790
We have a mission.
- Yeah Doyle, we have a mission.

667
01:02:33,896 --> 01:02:36,437
And our mission, Plan A is to find a planet...

668
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:38,978
...that can habitate the people
that are living on the Earth right now.

669
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:41,714
You can't just think about your family,
now you have to think bigger than that, alright?

670
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:44,809
I'm thinking about my family
and millions of other families.

671
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:49,816
Okay, Plan A does not work, if the people
on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

672
01:02:50,686 --> 01:02:54,058
No, it doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

673
01:02:55,754 --> 01:03:00,225
Okay. Cooper's right.
We have to think about time as a resource just like...

674
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:02,676
...oxygen and food.
Going down there is gonna cost us.

675
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:09,048
Okay look, Dr. Mann's data is promising, alright,

676
01:03:09,192 --> 01:03:12,670
but it's gonna take us months to get there,
and Edmunds, it's even further.

677
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,237
Now Miller hasn't said much.
But what she has said is very promising.

678
01:03:15,387 --> 01:03:18,141
It's water, it's organics.
- You don't find that everyday.

679
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:21,662
No, you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

680
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,038
...that would be spent trying to get back here.

681
01:03:25,526 --> 01:03:27,148
Romilly.
- Yeah.

682
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:31,594
How far off of Miller's planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

683
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:35,876
Alright, just back from the cusp.
- Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

684
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:38,428
Alright. Okay.

685
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:41,811
Here's Gargantua, here's Miller's planet.

686
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:45,597
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet, which would...

687
01:03:45,632 --> 01:03:48,443
...conserve fuel, but we'd lose a lot of time,

688
01:03:48,478 --> 01:03:53,016
what if, what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,
parallel with Miller's planet,

689
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,546
outside of its time shift, to here.
Then we take the Ranger down,

690
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:59,565
we get Miller, we get her samples,
we come back, we analyze, we debrief...

691
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,421
...we're in, we're out, we lose a little fuel.
But we save a lot of time.

692
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,442
That'll work.
- That's good. -There's not gonna...

693
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:09,340
be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there,
so TARS, you should definitely stay here.

694
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:13,135
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

695
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,591
If we are talking about a couple of years,

696
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,868
I could use the time to research gravity,

697
01:04:18,013 --> 01:04:20,499
observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

698
01:04:20,609 --> 01:04:24,903
TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua,
conserve fuel, minimize thrusting.

699
01:04:25,018 --> 01:04:27,427
Make sure we stay in range
from Miller's planet. You got it?

700
01:04:27,545 --> 01:04:30,759
I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand.

701
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:39,101
You ready CASE? -Yep.
- You don't say much do you?

702
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:44,009
TARS says plenty for both of us.
- Detach.

703
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:54,187
Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- Unbelievable.

704
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,622
A literal heart of darkness.

705
01:05:02,504 --> 01:05:06,777
If we could just see the collapsed star inside,

706
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:09,798
the singularity, we'd solve gravity.

707
01:05:09,911 --> 01:05:13,265
We can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon,

708
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:17,317
not even light.
All the answers are there, just no way to see it.

709
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:18,827
There's Miller's planet.

710
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:22,357
Goodbye Ranger.

711
01:05:35,117 --> 01:05:39,549
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

712
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:43,710
- No.
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.

713
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:46,849
Air-brake?
- We wanna get down fast don't we?

714
01:05:46,957 --> 01:05:50,352
Actually we wanna get there in one piece.
- Hang on.

715
01:05:50,425 --> 01:05:52,110
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

716
01:06:07,945 --> 01:06:10,677
We should ease now.
Hands where I can see 'em CASE.

717
01:06:10,757 --> 01:06:14,176
The only time I ever went down is
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

718
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:17,406
A little caution will help to get you killed.
- Just like reckless driving.

719
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,323
We're too fast. -I got this.

720
01:06:24,055 --> 01:06:28,126
Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

721
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:33,326
Here we go.

722
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:37,574
It's just water!

723
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:42,430
The stuff of life.
- 1200 meters.

724
01:06:42,547 --> 01:06:45,622
Do we have a fix on her beacon?
- That I have, can you maneuver?

725
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:50,534
I gonna need to shave some speed.
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it, everybody hang on!

726
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,855
700.

727
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:58,154
On my cue CASE, on my cue.

728
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:02,429
500 meters.

729
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:13,056
Fire!

730
01:07:27,132 --> 01:07:28,381
Very graceful.

731
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:32,873
No, but very efficient.

732
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:37,081
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

733
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:40,862
Go, go, go, go.
7 years per hour here.

734
01:07:40,969 --> 01:07:42,262
Let's make it count.

735
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:09,336
This way.

736
01:08:11,965 --> 01:08:14,055
About 200 meters.

737
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:28,664
Gravity's punishing.
- Been floating through space too long?

738
01:08:28,777 --> 01:08:31,078
130 % Earth's gravity.

739
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,834
Come on, come on, come on.

740
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:38,407
There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

741
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:43,537
If the, if the signal's coming from here, then...

742
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:54,128
Her beacon.

743
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:05,360
Wreckage.
- Where's the rest?

744
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,165
Towards the mountains.

745
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:12,533
Those aren't mountains.

746
01:09:15,048 --> 01:09:17,395
They're waves.
- What?

747
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:22,372
Shit.

748
01:09:24,467 --> 01:09:26,588
That one's moving away from us.

749
01:09:31,665 --> 01:09:34,433
We need the recorder.

750
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:47,326
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

751
01:09:47,404 --> 01:09:49,674
I'm not, leaving, without, her data.

752
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:55,278
Get back here now. We do not have time.
The second wave is coming!

753
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,866
We are in the middle of a swell!

754
01:09:57,975 --> 01:10:01,752
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

755
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,591
Brand get back here now!

756
01:10:10,026 --> 01:10:13,937
Cooper, go, Cooper go, I can't make it. Go!

757
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:15,270
CASE, go get her.

758
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,634
GO!
- Get up, get up Brand.

759
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:24,494
Go go, go.

760
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:29,350
I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes you are. Yes you are!

761
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,573
Come on CASE has her, CASE has her! Get back here Doyle!

762
01:10:41,346 --> 01:10:42,821
Dr. Brand.

763
01:10:44,515 --> 01:10:46,275
To the hatch.

764
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,302
Go, go. Go.

765
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:01,861
Manually overriding inside hatch!

766
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:09,918

767
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:11,152
Cooper!

768
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:16,848
Engines are flooded!
I'll have to shut it down!

769
01:11:49,989 --> 01:11:51,644
Oh shit!

770
01:11:56,428 --> 01:11:57,761
Whoaa!

771
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:32,064
CASE what's wrong?
- Too waterlogged, let it drain.

772
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:36,457
Goddamn it!
I told you to leave me.

773
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:38,974
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

774
01:12:39,048 --> 01:12:42,669
The difference is that one of
us was thinkin' about the mission.

775
01:12:42,778 --> 01:12:44,619
- You were thinking about getting home!

776
01:12:45,642 --> 01:12:50,614
I was trying to do the right thing!
- Can you tell that to Doyle?

777
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:55,504
CASE, how much time?
- 45 to an hour.

778
01:12:56,911 --> 01:12:58,626
The stuff of life huh?

779
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:02,610
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
- A lot.

780
01:13:03,493 --> 01:13:04,308
Decades.

781
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:14,384
What happened to Miller?
- Judging by...

782
01:13:14,499 --> 01:13:18,307
...the wreckage she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

783
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:21,878
How's the hell the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

784
01:13:23,141 --> 01:13:24,722
Because of the time slippage.

785
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:28,491
On this planet's time she,

786
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:30,624
she's landed hours ago, she...

787
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:33,653
...she probably just died minutes ago.

788
01:13:33,764 --> 01:13:37,609
The data Doyle received was just the initial
status echoing endlessly.

789
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,092
Oh we are not prepared for this.

790
01:13:42,509 --> 01:13:46,784
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a boy-scout troop.

791
01:13:46,816 --> 01:13:49,904
Well we got this far on our brains,
farther than any human in history.

792
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:54,573
Well not far enough.
And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...

793
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:55,760
...left on Earth to save.

794
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:01,242
I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.

795
01:14:04,993 --> 01:14:09,875
Is there any possibility?
I dunno, maybe some way, I don't know...

796
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:14,000
...maybe if we could jump in a black hole
and gain back the years?

797
01:14:14,502 --> 01:14:17,857
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative, okay.

798
01:14:17,965 --> 01:14:20,212
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but,

799
01:14:20,282 --> 01:14:24,031
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

800
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:28,300
The only thing that can move across dimensions,
like time, is gravity.

801
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:31,939
Okay.

802
01:14:33,809 --> 01:14:36,508
The beings that led us here,

803
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:39,712
they communicate through gravity, right?

804
01:14:39,863 --> 01:14:43,786
Could they be talking to us from the future?
- Maybe.

805
01:14:43,899 --> 01:14:47,403
Okay, if they can..?
They...

806
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:50,171
...are beings of 5 dimensions!

807
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:53,904
Right, to them, time might be
yet another physical dimension.

808
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:58,532
To them, the past might be a canyon
they can climb into,

809
01:14:58,638 --> 01:15:03,360
and the future, a mountain that they can climb up,
but to us, it's not! Okay!

810
01:15:03,435 --> 01:15:07,376
Look Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

811
01:15:08,674 --> 01:15:10,721
But you knew about relativity.

812
01:15:13,533 --> 01:15:14,509
Brand.

813
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:21,586
My daughter is 10 years old.

814
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:24,962
Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left,

815
01:15:24,997 --> 01:15:29,643
Couldn't you have told her
that you were going to save the world?
- No.

816
01:15:30,768 --> 01:15:35,476
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear,

817
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:40,273
And that's you wanna make sure your children feel safe,

818
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:45,101
and it rules out telling a 10 year old,
that the world's endin'.

819
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:48,421
Cooper.

820
01:15:52,141 --> 01:15:55,543
How long for the engines CASE?
- A minute or two.

821
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:57,790
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!

822
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:06,283
Brand, co-pilot you're up.
CASE, run the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters.

823
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:08,346
We're gonna spark it!
- Roger that.

824
01:16:08,459 --> 01:16:09,658
Depressurizing.

825
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,172
Engines up!

826
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:49,086
Hello Rom!
- I've waited years.

827
01:16:50,236 --> 01:16:51,807
How many, how many years?

828
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:58,416
By now it must be,
23 years, 4 months, 8 days.

829
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:03,461
Doyle?

830
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:13,914
I thought I was prepared... I knew the theory...

831
01:17:13,985 --> 01:17:16,501
...reality is different.

832
01:17:17,518 --> 01:17:18,373
And Miller?

833
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:21,548
There's nothing here for us.

834
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:29,077
Why didn't you sleep?
- Oh I had a couple of stretches.

835
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,037
I stopped believing that you were coming back.

836
01:17:32,116 --> 01:17:34,954
Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.

837
01:17:35,023 --> 01:17:38,017
I learned what I could from the black hole

838
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,488
but I couldn't send anything to your father.

839
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,370
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
- Is he alive?

840
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:48,416
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? -Yeah.

841
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,342
We've got years of messages stored.
- Cooper.

842
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:58,804
Messages span 23 years.

843
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,359
Play from the beginning.

844
01:18:05,732 --> 01:18:10,551
Hey Dad,
Just checkin' in, sayin' hi.

845
01:18:11,856 --> 01:18:15,198
Umm, finished 2nd in school,

846
01:18:15,308 --> 01:18:18,906
Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though,

847
01:18:19,055 --> 01:18:22,213
pulled me down,
but second's not bad.

848
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:25,631
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

849
01:18:27,227 --> 01:18:31,709
Umm, oh, I met another girl dad.

850
01:18:31,752 --> 01:18:36,769
I uh, I really think this is the one.

851
01:18:37,286 --> 01:18:39,901
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

852
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:45,195
Murphy stole grandpa's car,

853
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:48,971
She crashed it, she's okay though.

854
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:53,838
Hey Dad.
Look at this!

855
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:58,272
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

856
01:18:58,377 --> 01:19:03,528
I wanted to go with Coop, but
Lois says maybe next time.

857
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:06,103
And Grandpa says he's already earned the 'great' part so,

858
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:08,637
we just leave it at that.

859
01:19:08,752 --> 01:19:12,797

860
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,755
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

861
01:19:15,861 --> 01:19:18,815
Goodbye grandpa.

862
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:20,725
Sorry, it's been a while.

863
01:19:21,945 --> 01:19:28,016
It's..., what with Jesse and all...

864
01:19:32,466 --> 01:19:36,776
Uhh, grandpa died last week.

865
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:39,548
We buried him out in the back forty next to mom...

866
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:42,110
...and Jesse.

867
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:48,018
Which is where we would've buried you,
if you would've ever,... come back.

868
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:51,468
Murph was there at the funeral.

869
01:19:52,478 --> 01:19:55,130
We don't see her that much, but she came for that.

870
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,067
You're not listening to this, I know.

871
01:20:04,069 --> 01:20:09,606
All these messages are just, ... drifting...

872
01:20:09,713 --> 01:20:11,977
out there in the darkness.

873
01:20:12,085 --> 01:20:18,179
Lois says that, uh... I have to let you go.

874
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:20,376
And uh...

875
01:20:21,688 --> 01:20:22,524
...so...

876
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:29,026
I guess... I'll let you go.

877
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:32,267
I don't know where you're dad.

878
01:20:32,377 --> 01:20:35,941
But I hope that you're at peace. And...

879
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:38,559
Goodbye.

880
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:53,220
Hey Dad.

881
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:59,202
Hey Murph.
- You son of a bitch!

882
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:05,899
I never made one of these when you were still responding,

883
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,773
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

884
01:21:10,175 --> 01:21:13,013
And then when you went quiet,

885
01:21:15,819 --> 01:21:18,945
it seemed like I should've lived with that decision,
and I have,

886
01:21:22,913 --> 01:21:25,525
but today is my birthday,

887
01:21:28,818 --> 01:21:32,562
And it's a special one,
because you told me,

888
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:38,842
you once told me that when you come back...

889
01:21:38,956 --> 01:21:40,869
...we might be the same age.

890
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,753
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

891
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:52,019
So it would be a real good time for you to come back!

892
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:06,660
I didn't mean to intrude,

893
01:22:07,596 --> 01:22:11,748
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
- I've never been in here before.

894
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:18,580
I talk to Amelia, all the time.
It helps.

895
01:22:18,731 --> 01:22:22,803
I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't.

896
01:22:22,915 --> 01:22:27,282
Just had something which needed to get out.
- I know they're still out there.

897
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:27,685
I know.

898
01:22:27,802 --> 01:22:32,646
There are so many reasons why our communications
might not be getting through.

899
01:22:32,763 --> 01:22:33,944
I know Professor.

900
01:22:34,058 --> 01:22:38,092
I'm not sure, what I'm more afraid of.

901
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:41,200
Them never coming back or...

902
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:45,351
...coming back to find we've failed.

903
01:22:45,464 --> 01:22:48,861
Then let's succeed.
- So,

904
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:53,867
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

905
01:22:53,978 --> 01:22:57,558
With respect Professor, we've tried that
hundreds of times.

906
01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:01,189
- It only has to work once, Murph.

907
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:07,844
Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.

908
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:10,990
We've done well, in the world here,

909
01:23:11,098 --> 01:23:15,155
whether or not we crack the equation,
before I kick the bucket.

910
01:23:15,268 --> 01:23:18,939
Don't be morbid Professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

911
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:20,810
I am an old physicist.

912
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:24,096
I'm afraid of time.

913
01:23:30,732 --> 01:23:32,434
Time.

914
01:23:34,616 --> 01:23:36,449
You're afraid of time.

915
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,460
For years we've been trying
to solve the equation without changing...

916
01:23:41,547 --> 01:23:44,139
...the underlying assumption about time.
- And?

917
01:23:44,293 --> 01:23:48,252
What it means, is each iteration
is an attempt to prove it's own proof,

918
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:52,200
it's recursive,... it's nonsensical.

919
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:56,047
Are you calling my life's work nonsense, Murph?

920
01:23:57,329 --> 01:24:00,374
No, I'm saying that you've been trying
to finish it with one arm...

921
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:04,190
...no, with both arms tied behind your back.

922
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,212
And I don't understand why.

923
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:10,115
I am an old man Murph.

924
01:24:10,224 --> 01:24:13,751
Can we take this point up at another time?

925
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:15,914
I want to talk to my daughter.

926
01:24:17,429 --> 01:24:20,810
Stepping out into the universe,

927
01:24:20,927 --> 01:24:25,050
we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

928
01:24:25,162 --> 01:24:29,296
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.

929
01:24:30,557 --> 01:24:33,304
We must think, not as individuals,

930
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:35,614
but as a species.

931
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:41,937
'Do not go gentle into that good night.'

932
01:24:42,486 --> 01:24:45,588
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her...

933
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:48,398
...but the trip took years longer than we anticipated.

934
01:24:48,507 --> 01:24:51,334
We no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects,

935
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:53,993
so, we must choose.

936
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:56,228
But how?

937
01:24:57,595 --> 01:24:59,076
They're both promising.

938
01:25:00,378 --> 01:25:02,769
And Edmunds data is better,

939
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,553
but Dr. Mann is the one who's still transmitting. So...

940
01:25:05,663 --> 01:25:08,474
We've got no reason to suspect Edmunds data would've soured.

941
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:13,804
His world has key elements to sustain human life.
- As does Dr. Mann's.

942
01:25:13,877 --> 01:25:15,245
Cooper, this is my field.

943
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:21,245
And I really believe Edmunds' is the better prospect.
- Why?

944
01:25:21,358 --> 01:25:26,350
Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

945
01:25:26,461 --> 01:25:30,654
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes;
But no life. Sterile.

946
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:35,511
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
- Because of the black hole?

947
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:39,087
- Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen, will happen.

948
01:25:39,195 --> 01:25:41,865
Accidents are the first building block of evolution,

949
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:45,398
but when you're orbiting a black hole,
not enough can happen,

950
01:25:45,513 --> 01:25:49,378
it sucks in asteroids, comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

951
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:50,767
We need to go further afield.

952
01:25:51,516 --> 01:25:57,301
You once said that Dr. Mann, was the best of us.

953
01:25:57,411 --> 01:26:01,058
He is remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

954
01:26:01,165 --> 01:26:04,440
And, and yet here he is,
he is on the ground,

955
01:26:04,588 --> 01:26:09,209
and he's sending a very unambiguous message,
telling us to come to his planet.

956
01:26:10,194 --> 01:26:14,954
- Granted.
But Edmunds' data is more promising.

957
01:26:15,027 --> 01:26:18,834
- We should vote.
- Well, if we're going to vote, there's something you should know,

958
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:22,447
Brand, he has a right to know.

959
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:25,953
That has nothing to do with it.
- What does?

960
01:26:26,066 --> 01:26:29,210
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
- Is that true?

961
01:26:29,323 --> 01:26:30,545
Yes.

962
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:36,460
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

963
01:26:39,633 --> 01:26:43,678
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory,

964
01:26:43,756 --> 01:26:46,881
- You're a scientist Brand.
- So listen to me,

965
01:26:46,996 --> 01:26:51,640
When I say that love isn't
something we invented, it's...

966
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:55,314
...observable, powerful.

967
01:26:57,227 --> 01:27:01,933
It has to mean something.
- Love has meaning, yes, social utility...

968
01:27:01,934 --> 01:27:05,521
...social bonding, child rearing,
- We love people who have died,

969
01:27:05,628 --> 01:27:09,565
where's the social utility in that?
- None.

970
01:27:09,676 --> 01:27:12,473
- Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

971
01:27:12,546 --> 01:27:15,566
...yet understand.

972
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:18,977
Maybe it's, some evidence, some...

973
01:27:19,855 --> 01:27:24,626
...artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive,

974
01:27:24,749 --> 01:27:27,651
I'm drawn across the universe to someone...

975
01:27:27,724 --> 01:27:32,351
...I haven't seen in a decade.
Who, I know, is probably dead.

976
01:27:32,462 --> 01:27:35,485
Love is the one thing we're capable...

977
01:27:35,555 --> 01:27:38,778
...of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

978
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:43,107
Maybe we should trust that,

979
01:27:43,178 --> 01:27:46,110
even if we can't understand it yet.

980
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,821
Alright Cooper,

981
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:55,176
Yes!

982
01:27:56,687 --> 01:27:59,895
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

983
01:28:00,116 --> 01:28:04,843
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
- Honestly Amelia,

984
01:28:06,757 --> 01:28:08,122
it might.

985
01:28:13,842 --> 01:28:17,615
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

986
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:42,891
We'll lose about a third again. Next year.
Next year, I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and I'm gonna make it up.

987
01:28:43,004 --> 01:28:44,910
What happened to Nelson?

988
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:55,608
Murph, can I get you anything?
Would you like some more Souffl?
- No, I'm full. Thanks.

989
01:28:55,719 --> 01:28:56,583
It was delicious.

990
01:28:57,987 --> 01:28:59,426
Hand me that donut please.

991
01:29:01,551 --> 01:29:05,993
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...

992
01:29:06,028 --> 01:29:09,379
- I need to get back.
- My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty...

993
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:12,454
- I need to...

994
01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:18,037
...too many memories.
- Well, we have something for that.

995
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:19,405

996
01:29:26,812 --> 01:29:27,915
Dust.

997
01:29:29,535 --> 01:29:32,811
Lois, I have a friend who could...

998
01:29:32,891 --> 01:29:35,080
...look at his lungs.

999
01:29:53,236 --> 01:29:56,263
Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You're just being objective.

1000
01:29:56,335 --> 01:29:59,530
Unless you're punishing me,
for screwing up on Miller's planet,

1001
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,737
- No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1002
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:06,272
Well, if you're wrong, you have
a very personal decision to make.

1003
01:30:06,383 --> 01:30:10,415
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1004
01:30:10,524 --> 01:30:13,464
Strike out on Mann's planet and you'll
have to decide whether...

1005
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:17,026
...to return home, or push onto Edmunds with plan B.

1006
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:20,999
Starting a colony could save us from extinction.

1007
01:30:21,113 --> 01:30:23,853
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

1008
01:30:23,964 --> 01:30:25,901
...or the future of the human race.

1009
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,973
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1010
01:30:35,122 --> 01:30:38,397
He has been asking for you since he came to.

1011
01:30:38,472 --> 01:30:39,770
We were trying to reach you.

1012
01:30:45,461 --> 01:30:49,155
Murph?
- Hey.
I'm here Professor.

1013
01:30:49,264 --> 01:30:52,644
I think I let you all down.

1014
01:30:52,758 --> 01:30:55,820
No, you got us this far.
We're close.

1015
01:30:57,161 --> 01:30:59,399
I will finish what you started.

1016
01:30:59,513 --> 01:31:02,630
Good, good Murph.

1017
01:31:02,744 --> 01:31:06,938
You had faith.

1018
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:12,484
All those, all those years,

1019
01:31:13,356 --> 01:31:17,483
I asked you to have faith,

1020
01:31:18,609 --> 01:31:29,635
I wanted you to believe, that your father,... would come back.

1021
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:31,903
I do Professor.

1022
01:31:33,637 --> 01:31:37,559
Forgive me Murph.
- There's nothing to forgive.

1023
01:31:39,467 --> 01:31:44,286
I lied Murph,

1024
01:31:45,405 --> 01:31:47,716
I lied to you.

1025
01:31:53,441 --> 01:32:00,399
There was no need for him, to come back.

1026
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:06,786
There's no way to help us.

1027
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:10,193
But the Plan A? All this?

1028
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:15,570
All these people.
And the equation?

1029
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:20,881
Did my father know?

1030
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:26,383
Did he leave me?

1031
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:39,204
'Do.... not.... go.... gentle....'

1032
01:32:39,396 --> 01:32:45,176
No. NO!

1033
01:32:45,294 --> 01:32:49,595
You can't leave.
NO!

1034
01:32:49,705 --> 01:32:53,801
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1035
01:32:53,908 --> 01:32:57,007
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1036
01:32:57,087 --> 01:32:59,854
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1037
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:14,637
Brand did you know?

1038
01:33:16,154 --> 01:33:18,431
He told you right?

1039
01:33:20,032 --> 01:33:22,692
You knew?

1040
01:33:23,743 --> 01:33:26,191
This was all a sham.

1041
01:33:30,826 --> 01:33:32,444
You left us here.

1042
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:36,263
To suffocate.

1043
01:33:37,522 --> 01:33:39,354
To starve.

1044
01:34:06,363 --> 01:34:08,534
Frozen cloud.

1045
01:36:32,492 --> 01:36:35,756
It's okay.

1046
01:36:41,013 --> 01:36:44,026
It's okay.

1047
01:36:44,144 --> 01:36:46,086
It's okay.

1048
01:36:48,882 --> 01:36:51,167
Pray you never learn,

1049
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:55,522
just how good it can be to see another face.

1050
01:37:03,707 --> 01:37:08,997
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

1051
01:37:10,727 --> 01:37:13,460
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1052
01:37:15,338 --> 01:37:19,535
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1053
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:25,993
You've literally raised me from the dead.

1054
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:28,228
Lazarus.

1055
01:37:29,384 --> 01:37:33,372
What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it sir.

1056
01:37:34,385 --> 01:37:36,302
So far, surely.

1057
01:37:36,878 --> 01:37:39,556
No. In our present situation...

1058
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:42,363
...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.

1059
01:37:45,452 --> 01:37:46,873
Dr. Mann.

1060
01:37:47,243 --> 01:37:50,508
Dr. Mann, tell us about your world.

1061
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,757
Our world, we hope...

1062
01:37:58,146 --> 01:38:07,239
Our world is cold, stark,
but undeniably beautiful.

1063
01:38:09,158 --> 01:38:12,488
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1064
01:38:16,378 --> 01:38:20,297
The nights are 67 far colder hours.

1065
01:38:25,302 --> 01:38:31,217
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 % of the Earth's.

1066
01:38:31,331 --> 01:38:34,502
Now here, where I landed,
the water is alkali.

1067
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:38,316
And the air has too much ammonia in it
to breathe for more than just a few minutes.

1068
01:38:38,317 --> 01:38:42,996
But, down at the surface, and there is, a surface,

1069
01:38:43,066 --> 01:38:47,643
the chlorine dissipates,
the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

1070
01:38:47,751 --> 01:38:50,486
Breathable air, to organics.

1071
01:38:50,596 --> 01:38:53,333
Possibly even, to life.

1072
01:38:53,414 --> 01:38:56,258
We might be sharing this world.

1073
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:58,654
These readings are from the surface?

1074
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:03,487
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
- How far have you explored?

1075
01:39:03,596 --> 01:39:06,547
I have managed several major expeditions,
but with oxygen in...

1076
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:11,567
...limited supply, KIPP there,
really did most of the legwork.
- What went wrong with him sir?

1077
01:39:11,646 --> 01:39:14,471
Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics...

1078
01:39:14,472 --> 01:39:19,436
...we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but...

1079
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:23,405
...ultimately I decommissioned him,
used his power source to keep the mission going.

1080
01:39:23,594 --> 01:39:27,770
I thought I was alone before I even shut him down.
- Would you like me to look at him?

1081
01:39:27,842 --> 01:39:31,190
No, no, he needs a human touch.

1082
01:39:31,262 --> 01:39:33,511
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message...

1083
01:39:33,512 --> 01:39:37,800
...for you, from the Comm. Station
- Okay, be right there. Excuse me.

1084
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:53,392
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1085
01:39:53,505 --> 01:39:59,199
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1086
01:40:01,516 --> 01:40:03,501
I'm sorry for your loss.

1087
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,714
Is that Murph?
- She's,... she's grown!

1088
01:40:10,787 --> 01:40:11,798
Brand did you know?

1089
01:40:13,206 --> 01:40:14,721
He told you right?

1090
01:40:17,063 --> 01:40:19,073
You knew?

1091
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:24,851
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

1092
01:40:26,006 --> 01:40:28,669
To suffocate.

1093
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,070
To starve.

1094
01:40:35,777 --> 01:40:37,330
Did my father know too?

1095
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:40,789
Dad.

1096
01:40:43,026 --> 01:40:48,997
Did my father know?
If you left me here to die?

1097
01:40:50,157 --> 01:40:53,080
I just have to know!

1098
01:40:58,197 --> 01:41:06,934
Cooper, my father dedicated
his whole life to plan A, I have...

1099
01:41:07,009 --> 01:41:09,131
...no idea what she's talking about.

1100
01:41:10,217 --> 01:41:11,702
I do.

1101
01:41:16,133 --> 01:41:20,017
Why he, he never even hoped to get the
people off the Earth?

1102
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:21,708
No.

1103
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:29,991
But he has been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1104
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:34,312
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1105
01:41:34,386 --> 01:41:36,302
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1106
01:41:36,411 --> 01:41:40,878
The equation couldn't reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics
You need more.

1107
01:41:40,951 --> 01:41:45,574
More? More what?
- More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1108
01:41:45,575 --> 01:41:49,715
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
- Romilly, is that true?

1109
01:41:50,553 --> 01:41:54,793
If the black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1110
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,213
The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...

1111
01:41:57,286 --> 01:41:59,045
...in darkness, behind the horizon.

1112
01:42:00,136 --> 01:42:02,366
That's why we call it a 'black' hole.

1113
01:42:02,475 --> 01:42:06,700
Okay,... what if we see beyond the horizon?

1114
01:42:06,775 --> 01:42:10,862
We can't.
- There are some things that aren't meant to be known.

1115
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:15,397
Your father had to find another way to save
the human race from extinction.

1116
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,964
Plan B, a colony.
- But why not tell people?

1117
01:42:20,413 --> 01:42:21,793
Why keep it from us?

1118
01:42:21,907 --> 01:42:24,283
Because he knew how hard it would be
to get people...

1119
01:42:24,284 --> 01:42:29,282
...to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

1120
01:42:29,387 --> 01:42:30,471
Bullshit!

1121
01:42:30,579 --> 01:42:33,324
You never would have come here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1122
01:42:33,438 --> 01:42:36,198
Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier.

1123
01:42:36,272 --> 01:42:40,482
We can care deeply, selflessly
about those we know.

1124
01:42:40,553 --> 01:42:44,911
But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
- But the lie?

1125
01:42:48,263 --> 01:42:52,839
That monstrous lie?
- Unforgivable.

1126
01:42:52,951 --> 01:42:57,738
And he knew that.
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity,

1127
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:01,342
in order to save the species,
he made an incredible sacrifice.

1128
01:43:01,456 --> 01:43:05,950
NO! No, an incredible sacrifice is being made,

1129
01:43:06,025 --> 01:43:08,929
by the people on Earth who're gonna die!

1130
01:43:08,936 --> 01:43:13,581
Because in his fucking arrogance,
he declared their case hopeless.

1131
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:18,145
I'm sorry Cooper,
their case is hopeless.

1132
01:43:18,187 --> 01:43:22,413
No. No.
- We are the future.

1133
01:43:23,852 --> 01:43:25,073
Cooper.

1134
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,752
Cooper, what I can do?

1135
01:43:30,635 --> 01:43:32,509
Let me go home.

1136
01:43:33,016 --> 01:43:35,679
You're absolutely positive?

1137
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:40,297
His solution was correct. He's had it for years.
- It's worthless?

1138
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:41,999
It's half the answer.

1139
01:43:42,585 --> 01:43:46,132
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1140
01:43:46,245 --> 01:43:49,384
Out there, in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

1141
01:43:49,493 --> 01:43:51,007
Yeah?

1142
01:43:52,235 --> 01:43:53,744
I'm not sure you can.

1143
01:43:54,689 --> 01:43:58,589
God, they just pack up and leave.

1144
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:03,976
What're they hoping to find?
- Survival.

1145
01:44:11,224 --> 01:44:12,555
Damn it!

1146
01:44:15,623 --> 01:44:19,469
Murph, don't, don't people have a right to know?

1147
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:24,010
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1148
01:44:24,081 --> 01:44:27,300
Yes, but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

1149
01:44:27,408 --> 01:44:30,723
- Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1150
01:44:31,381 --> 01:44:35,245
So, do you have an idea?

1151
01:44:36,431 --> 01:44:37,906
A feeling.

1152
01:44:40,427 --> 01:44:42,849
I told you about my ghost.

1153
01:44:44,404 --> 01:44:48,952
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

1154
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,491
But I was never scared of it.

1155
01:44:55,467 --> 01:45:03,205
I called it a ghost because
it felt.... like a person,

1156
01:45:04,969 --> 01:45:07,814
who was trying to tell me something.

1157
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:13,184
If there is an answer
here on Earth, it's back there,

1158
01:45:13,256 --> 01:45:17,502
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

1159
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,978
We're running out of time.

1160
01:45:24,024 --> 01:45:27,154
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1161
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:30,922
They can stay CASE.
I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway.
- Hey Coop. -Yeah?

1162
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:34,474
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
- What is that?

1163
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:36,459
Have one last crack at the black hole.

1164
01:45:37,767 --> 01:45:41,269
I'm going home Rom.
- Yeah I know.

1165
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:46,033
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

1166
01:45:46,111 --> 01:45:49,877
Talk to me.
- Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.

1167
01:45:49,985 --> 01:45:53,200
It is what we call a 'gentle' singularity.
- Gentle?

1168
01:45:53,322 --> 01:45:57,718
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...

1169
01:45:57,825 --> 01:46:02,105
...crossing the horizon fast, might survive.
A probe say.

1170
01:46:02,177 --> 01:46:03,657
What happens after it crosses?

1171
01:46:03,736 --> 01:46:06,618
After, the horizon,
is a complete mystery.

1172
01:46:06,691 --> 01:46:09,487
So, what's to say that there isn't some
way that the probe can...

1173
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,412
...glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1174
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:16,564
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...

1175
01:46:16,653 --> 01:46:21,508
Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor?
- TARS is the obvious candidate.

1176
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:24,225
I've already told him what to look for.

1177
01:46:24,341 --> 01:46:28,555
I'll need the old optical transmitter on KIPP, Cooper.
- You would do this for us?

1178
01:46:28,663 --> 01:46:31,504
Before you get all teary,
try to remember that as a robot...

1179
01:46:31,578 --> 01:46:35,190
...I have to do anything you say.
- Your cue light's broken.

1180
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:36,680
I'm not joking!

1181
01:46:38,304 --> 01:46:43,029
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1182
01:46:43,099 --> 01:46:46,682
Well, I don't wanna disturb his archival functions.
- I'll supervise.

1183
01:46:46,792 --> 01:46:50,971
Alright.
- Dr. Mann, we need to find 3 secure sites.

1184
01:46:51,051 --> 01:46:53,314
One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.

1185
01:46:53,428 --> 01:46:55,977
Once those modules have landed,
you don't wanna move.

1186
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:58,234
Well I can take you to the probes sites,
but I don't think this...

1187
01:46:58,349 --> 01:47:01,263
...these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1188
01:47:01,374 --> 01:47:04,256
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

1189
01:47:04,339 --> 01:47:06,927
I would really like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1190
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:12,437
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1191
01:47:12,515 --> 01:47:15,609
Okay then.
- But you're gonna need a long-range transmitter.

1192
01:47:15,723 --> 01:47:17,499
Right.
- Are you charged? -Yeah.

1193
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:18,995
Follow me.

1194
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:23,804
TARS, 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper.

1195
01:47:29,979 --> 01:47:33,033
Brand told me why you feel you've got to go back.

1196
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:38,625
But I'd be remiss
if didn't at least mention that a mission...

1197
01:47:38,697 --> 01:47:41,862
...such as ours could certainly do
with an extra engineer.

1198
01:47:43,322 --> 01:47:45,666
Oh you better slow down turbo.

1199
01:47:45,778 --> 01:47:50,717
Safety first CASE, remember.
- Safety first Cooper.

1200
01:47:50,795 --> 01:47:55,256
I have to tell you Dr. Mann
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1201
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:57,527
But once we set up
base camp and...

1202
01:47:57,641 --> 01:48:01,992
...secure those modules, my work is done here.
I'm going home.

1203
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:06,955

1204
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:11,556
We have attachments.

1205
01:48:11,632 --> 01:48:15,918
But even without a family,
I can, promise you that, that yearning...

1206
01:48:16,024 --> 01:48:18,505
...to be with other people is remarkable.

1207
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:24,581
That emotion is, at the foundation, of what makes us human.

1208
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:25,781
It's not to be taken lightly

1209
01:48:33,266 --> 01:48:36,925
How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1210
01:48:46,857 --> 01:48:49,156
Mom let's me play in here.

1211
01:48:49,698 --> 01:48:52,034
I don't touch your stuff.

1212
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,733
Just take this gently.

1213
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:33,619
You know why we couldn't just send
machines on these missions, don't you Cooper?

1214
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:38,709
A machine doesn't improvise well,
because you can't programme the fear of death.

1215
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:43,345
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest source of inspiration.

1216
01:49:43,455 --> 01:49:45,447
Take you for example,

1217
01:49:46,341 --> 01:49:51,499
A father, with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1218
01:49:51,622 --> 01:49:56,965
What does research tell us, is the
last thing you're gonna see, before you die?

1219
01:49:58,408 --> 01:50:01,798
Your children.
Their faces.

1220
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:05,976
At the moment of death, your mind
is going to push you a little bit harder, to survive.

1221
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:09,642
For them.

1222
01:50:11,737 --> 01:50:15,759
Hey, I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me.

1223
01:50:15,886 --> 01:50:18,328
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.

1224
01:50:18,687 --> 01:50:20,462
OK? -Yes.

1225
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:32,881
TARS, what's taking so long?
- Professor, I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

1226
01:50:32,992 --> 01:50:34,782
I don't understand?

1227
01:50:41,562 --> 01:50:42,755
It's funny.

1228
01:50:44,727 --> 01:50:49,790
When I left Earth,
I thought I was prepared to die.

1229
01:50:50,764 --> 01:50:58,044
The truth is, I never really, considered...

1230
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:00,455
...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1231
01:51:02,567 --> 01:51:06,659
Nothing worked out the way it was supposed to.
- Let's go.

1232
01:51:12,313 --> 01:51:14,891
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

1233
01:51:23,002 --> 01:51:25,218
What is this?
- What are you doing?

1234
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:28,683
I'm sorry, I can't let you leave
with that ship.

1235
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:31,420
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

1236
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:36,527
Once the others, realize what this place isn't.
We cannot survive here.

1237
01:51:36,604 --> 01:51:38,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1238
01:51:48,981 --> 01:51:50,299
They can't stay here anymore.

1239
01:51:50,373 --> 01:51:53,995
You have to leave, right now.
Hey buddy, let me make something abundantly clear...

1240
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:56,837
You have a responsibility.
- Shit.

1241
01:51:56,949 --> 01:51:59,543
Coop, get her stuff, she's goin' home.

1242
01:51:59,653 --> 01:52:01,723
- Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!

1243
01:52:01,802 --> 01:52:04,099
Dad didn't raise me, grandpa did,
and he's buried...

1244
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,614
...out back with mom and Jesse.

1245
01:52:05,649 --> 01:52:15,103
You faked all the data?
Yes.

1246
01:52:17,177 --> 01:52:22,009
There's no surface.
No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.

1247
01:52:22,119 --> 01:52:26,932
But I knew, the day that I arrived here,
this place had nothing...

1248
01:52:27,008 --> 01:52:31,289
...and I resisted the temptation, for years

1249
01:52:31,364 --> 01:52:39,320
But, I knew that, if I just pressed
that button, then, somebody would come and save me.

1250
01:52:40,446 --> 01:52:43,825
You fucking coward!
- Yes.

1251
01:52:48,806 --> 01:52:50,208
Yes.

1252
01:52:51,582 --> 01:52:53,129
Yes.

1253
01:52:54,135 --> 01:52:55,069
Yes.

1254
01:53:06,932 --> 01:53:11,685
Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your family go.
Just let,... save your family.

1255
01:53:11,717 --> 01:53:16,574
And go to live underground? With you?
Pray that daddy comes to save us?

1256
01:53:16,644 --> 01:53:20,569
Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back.
It's up to me!

1257
01:53:20,613 --> 01:53:25,477
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad couldn't do it? -DAD DIDN'T EVEN TRY!

1258
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:27,293
Dad just abandoned us!

1259
01:53:28,483 --> 01:53:32,733
He left us here to die.
- Nobody is going with you.

1260
01:53:36,618 --> 01:53:38,822
You're gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1261
01:53:41,851 --> 01:53:45,745
Get out, and don't come back!

1262
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:52,352
Do what you want with those things.

1263
01:54:03,037 --> 01:54:04,740
Stop it!

1264
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:09,061
No. NO!

1265
01:54:09,998 --> 01:54:13,347
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourself.

1266
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,156
Those are the best odds I've had in years!

1267
01:54:36,209 --> 01:54:41,041
Don't judge me Cooper.
You were never tested like I was.

1268
01:54:41,486 --> 01:54:43,414
Few men have been.

1269
01:54:51,704 --> 01:54:53,400
You tried your best Murph.

1270
01:55:02,209 --> 01:55:04,123
Do you feel it?

1271
01:55:05,133 --> 01:55:07,431
The survival instinct.

1272
01:55:08,336 --> 01:55:13,011
That's what drove me.
It's what drives all of us, and it's what's gonna save us.

1273
01:55:13,087 --> 01:55:16,843
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

1274
01:55:21,963 --> 01:55:25,979
I'm sorry, I can't,
I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry.

1275
01:55:26,055 --> 01:55:28,324
I thought I could, but I can't.

1276
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:32,054
I'm here, I'm here for you.

1277
01:55:32,161 --> 01:55:35,953
Just listen to my voice Cooper, I'm right here.

1278
01:55:37,078 --> 01:55:39,709
You're not alone.

1279
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,049
Do you see your children?

1280
01:55:53,537 --> 01:55:57,661
It's okay.
They're right there with you.

1281
01:56:01,522 --> 01:56:04,802
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem
before you left?

1282
01:56:04,912 --> 01:56:06,606
Do you remember?

1283
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:12,300
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

1284
01:56:12,413 --> 01:56:18,129
'Old age should burn, and rave
at close of day.'

1285
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,821
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

1286
01:56:47,233 --> 01:56:50,127
Amelia! Help!
- Cooper?

1287
01:56:57,045 --> 01:56:59,864
CASE!
- Brand.

1288
01:57:00,818 --> 01:57:01,694
No air!

1289
01:57:03,726 --> 01:57:07,174
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have a fix.

1290
01:57:07,256 --> 01:57:09,590
Go, go, go!

1291
01:57:21,341 --> 01:57:24,178
Cooper we're coming, hang in there, don't talk!

1292
01:57:24,251 --> 01:57:26,762
Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!

1293
01:57:29,774 --> 01:57:32,244
There is a security lockout sir, it requires...

1294
01:57:32,326 --> 01:57:35,017
...a person to access the functions.

1295
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:42,784
It's all yours sir.

1296
01:57:54,161 --> 01:57:59,056

1297
01:57:59,163 --> 01:58:00,082
Cooper!

1298
01:58:03,788 --> 01:58:06,163
Hang in there, we're coming

1299
01:58:12,387 --> 01:58:16,816
I see him! I see him!
To the right. Bank right!

1300
01:58:34,848 --> 01:58:38,107
Cooper!
Cooper!

1301
01:58:43,653 --> 01:58:44,672
Take this

1302
01:58:52,514 --> 01:58:54,203
Joey bring the tankers

1303
01:59:00,785 --> 01:59:03,122
This data makes no sense.

1304
01:59:10,742 --> 01:59:14,275
I'm sorry.
- What?

1305
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:16,233
Mann, was lying!

1306
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:25,890

1307
01:59:26,014 --> 01:59:28,927
Romilly!

1308
01:59:29,036 --> 01:59:32,324
Romilly, do you read me?
Romilly!

1309
01:59:32,433 --> 01:59:34,207
No NO NO! DON'T DO THAT!

1310
01:59:41,572 --> 01:59:44,849
Romilly. -Romilly! Do you read me?!

1311
01:59:47,203 --> 01:59:48,821
Keep watch!

1312
01:59:49,973 --> 01:59:53,598
Lois!
- What happened to caution CASE?

1313
01:59:53,676 --> 01:59:55,041
Safety first Cooper.

1314
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:58,860
Romilly, Romilly do you read me? This is Brand.

1315
02:00:01,627 --> 02:00:05,680
Romilly!
- Dr. Brand, Cooper, there's been an explosion.

1316
02:00:05,794 --> 02:00:07,728
Dr. Mann's compound.

1317
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,562
TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock.

1318
02:00:44,045 --> 02:00:46,006
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

1319
02:00:49,571 --> 02:00:51,336
Romilly did not survive.

1320
02:00:52,563 --> 02:00:56,448
I could not save him.
- TARS is in. -I'll take it from here!

1321
02:00:56,559 --> 02:00:58,945
D'you have a fix on the Ranger?
- He is pushing into orbit.

1322
02:00:59,058 --> 02:01:02,272
Ah, if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

1323
02:01:03,503 --> 02:01:06,751
He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us!

1324
02:01:08,084 --> 02:01:11,677
Get downstairs. Go wait by the car.

1325
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:22,277
Come on.
Get in the back!

1326
02:01:22,346 --> 02:01:23,358
Get in the back seat, now!

1327
02:01:28,537 --> 02:01:33,222
Dr. Mann please respond!
Dr. Mann please respond!

1328
02:01:33,336 --> 02:01:37,333
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure.
- But the autopilot does.

1329
02:01:37,446 --> 02:01:41,220
Not since TARS disabled it!
- Nice!

1330
02:01:41,293 --> 02:01:44,104
What is your trust setting TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently!

1331
02:01:48,955 --> 02:01:52,024
Do not attempt docking, I repeat do not attempt docking.

1332
02:02:51,375 --> 02:02:54,111
Auto docking sequence withheld.

1333
02:02:54,148 --> 02:02:58,461
Override. -Unauthorized.
- Override!

1334
02:02:58,537 --> 02:03:00,665
Unauthorized.

1335
02:03:05,076 --> 02:03:09,717
Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not! Attempt docking! Please resp...

1336
02:03:53,250 --> 02:03:55,163
Moving slowly towards the Endurance.

1337
02:04:19,451 --> 02:04:23,791
Imperfect contact.
- Override! -Hatch locked.

1338
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:33,649
Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.

1339
02:04:35,683 --> 02:04:37,368
Dr. Mann...

1340
02:04:58,024 --> 02:05:00,978
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1341
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:13,785
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1342
02:05:13,858 --> 02:05:18,628
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize.

1343
02:05:44,072 --> 02:05:47,087
What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1344
02:05:52,841 --> 02:05:57,128
Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters full
move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!

1345
02:05:57,381 --> 02:06:00,151
CASE relay my message
to the onboard computer...

1346
02:06:00,265 --> 02:06:01,769
...and have it rebroadcast
as emergency PA.

1347
02:06:01,804 --> 02:06:07,687
Dr. Mann, do not open the air hatch.

1348
02:06:07,796 --> 02:06:10,098
I repeat, do not... -Brand?

1349
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:15,141
I don't know what he said to you?
But I'm taking command of the Endurance.

1350
02:06:15,217 --> 02:06:17,993
And then we're gonna talk about completing the mission.

1351
02:06:20,512 --> 02:06:23,352
Dr. Mann, listen to me!

1352
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:27,315
This is not about my life, or Cooper's life,

1353
02:06:27,422 --> 02:06:29,194
This is about all mankind.

1354
02:06:30,283 --> 02:06:31,313
There is a moment...

1355
02:06:38,081 --> 02:06:39,121
It is not...

1356
02:06:47,259 --> 02:06:48,945
Oh, my God.

1357
02:07:06,853 --> 02:07:12,597
Cooper there's no point in using your fuel...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1358
02:07:16,674 --> 02:07:19,481
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1359
02:07:22,353 --> 02:07:25,530
Endurance's rotation is 67, 68 rpm.

1360
02:07:25,603 --> 02:07:29,747
Get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters.
- It's not possible.

1361
02:07:29,829 --> 02:07:31,875
- No, it's necessary.

1362
02:07:42,953 --> 02:07:45,651
Endurance is entering the stratosphere.

1363
02:07:49,879 --> 02:07:51,503
She's got no heat shield!

1364
02:07:53,953 --> 02:07:56,610
CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1365
02:08:04,979 --> 02:08:07,798
Cooper, this is no time for caution.

1366
02:08:09,565 --> 02:08:11,581
CASE, if I blackout, you take the stick.

1367
02:08:11,693 --> 02:08:15,182
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1368
02:08:21,571 --> 02:08:25,011
Endurance is starting to heat.
- 20 feet out.

1369
02:08:25,093 --> 02:08:28,940
I need three degrees starboard Cooper.
- 10 feet out.

1370
02:08:29,049 --> 02:08:32,581
Cooper, we are, lined up!

1371
02:08:32,697 --> 02:08:34,093
Initiate spin!

1372
02:09:15,997 --> 02:09:17,286
Come on TARS!

1373
02:09:25,099 --> 02:09:26,390
Come on.

1374
02:09:36,858 --> 02:09:40,323
We are locked Cooper.
- EASING UP!

1375
02:09:47,567 --> 02:09:49,665
Slowly.

1376
02:09:50,692 --> 02:09:51,945
Slowly.

1377
02:09:57,219 --> 02:09:59,160
Retro thrusters!

1378
02:10:06,663 --> 02:10:08,948
Main engines on!

1379
02:10:14,061 --> 02:10:17,545
We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!

1380
02:10:25,121 --> 02:10:26,747
Shutting down engines.

1381
02:10:27,825 --> 02:10:29,813
Okay we're out of orbit!

1382
02:10:37,379 --> 02:10:40,616
Okay! And for our next trick!

1383
02:10:41,554 --> 02:10:45,703
It better be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1384
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:50,213
Shit. CASE take the stick.
- Roger that.

1385
02:11:39,345 --> 02:11:42,253
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1386
02:11:42,401 --> 02:11:44,924
Shall I use the engines?

1387
02:11:45,036 --> 02:11:49,348
No, we gotta let her slide as far as we can!

1388
02:11:58,609 --> 02:12:01,433
Give it to me.
- It's good news and bad news Cooper.

1389
02:12:01,543 --> 02:12:05,433
Yeah, to hell with it TARS.
Just give it to me straight.

1390
02:12:13,067 --> 02:12:17,104
The back-up generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1391
02:12:18,274 --> 02:12:22,491
Good! Okay.
The navigational hub's been completely destroyed.

1392
02:12:22,599 --> 02:12:25,216
We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth,

1393
02:12:25,291 --> 02:12:29,229
but I think we can scratch over to Edmunds' planet.
- What about fuel?

1394
02:12:29,339 --> 02:12:32,042
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

1395
02:12:32,081 --> 02:12:35,595
We let, Gargantua, pull us down close...

1396
02:12:35,598 --> 02:12:38,729
to the horizon, and a powered slingshot...

1397
02:12:38,848 --> 02:12:41,503
...around launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
- Manually?

1398
02:12:41,615 --> 02:12:45,282
That's what I'm here for.
I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.

1399
02:12:45,357 --> 02:12:46,865
What about the time slippage?

1400
02:12:46,979 --> 02:12:50,472
Neither one of us have time
to worry about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

1401
02:12:55,075 --> 02:12:56,063
Sorry Cooper.

1402
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:01,330
Once we have gathered enough speed...

1403
02:13:01,402 --> 02:13:04,454
...around Gargantua,
we use Lander 1,

1404
02:13:04,953 --> 02:13:07,590
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...

1405
02:13:07,847 --> 02:13:10,512
...to push us out of the black hole's gravity

1406
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:14,904
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed,

1407
02:13:14,981 --> 02:13:17,970
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

1408
02:13:19,447 --> 02:13:22,725
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1409
02:13:22,834 --> 02:13:27,052
...and get sucked right into that black hole!
- Why does TARS have to detach?

1410
02:13:27,163 --> 02:13:31,651
We have to shed the weight, escape gravity.
- Newton's third law.

1411
02:13:31,727 --> 02:13:35,603
The only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.

1412
02:13:35,759 --> 02:13:40,661
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
- He's a robot...

1413
02:13:40,776 --> 02:13:44,871
...so you don't have to ask him to do anything.
- Cooper, you asshole!

1414
02:13:44,943 --> 02:13:49,320
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
- It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

1415
02:13:49,337 --> 02:13:52,287
It's our only chance to save people on Earth,

1416
02:13:52,364 --> 02:13:57,126
if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there,
they might still make it.

1417
02:13:58,714 --> 02:14:01,051
Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.

1418
02:14:29,609 --> 02:14:31,460
Maximum velocity achieved.

1419
02:14:31,536 --> 02:14:36,376
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

1420
02:14:36,449 --> 02:14:38,985
Ready?
- Ready. -Ready.

1421
02:14:39,071 --> 02:14:45,286
Main engine ignition in 3, 2, 1...

1422
02:15:00,974 --> 02:15:03,072
Engines of Lander 1 on my command,

1423
02:15:03,983 --> 02:15:08,928
3, 2, 1...

1424
02:15:13,192 --> 02:15:16,321
Engines of Ranger 2 on my command,

1425
02:15:16,395 --> 02:15:20,956
3, 2, 1...

1426
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:34,136
This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years!

1427
02:15:34,214 --> 02:15:37,528
You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!

1428
02:15:52,641 --> 02:15:55,815
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark,

1429
02:15:55,925 --> 02:16:01,748
3, 2, 1... mark

1430
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:02,874
Detach!

1431
02:16:05,779 --> 02:16:10,347
Goodbye TARS!
- Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.

1432
02:16:10,424 --> 02:16:11,768
See you there slick!

1433
02:16:20,301 --> 02:16:23,754
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

1434
02:16:23,869 --> 02:16:26,333
Learned from the master!

1435
02:16:26,414 --> 02:16:28,921
Ranger 2, prepare for detachment.

1436
02:16:29,004 --> 02:16:32,683
- What, no, no! Cooper, Cooper,
what are you doing?

1437
02:16:32,791 --> 02:16:36,060
Newton's third law.
You gotta leave something behind!

1438
02:16:36,429 --> 02:16:40,838
You said we had enough resources for both of us!
- We agreed Amelia,

1439
02:16:40,873 --> 02:16:43,405
90 %

1440
02:16:43,518 --> 02:16:45,680
No!

1441
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:49,130
Detach.

1442
02:17:02,513 --> 02:17:04,939
Okay, we're nosing down.

1443
02:17:08,419 --> 02:17:10,650
Approaching the event horizon.

1444
02:17:11,843 --> 02:17:23,948
Portside, dipping down beneath it..., to go through it.
Heading towards... blackness...

1445
02:17:24,172 --> 02:17:26,044
It's all black!

1446
02:17:28,385 --> 02:17:32,463
TARS, do you read me? It's all black.

1447
02:17:33,261 --> 02:17:36,122
TARS, do you read me? Over.

1448
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:47,070
We're... we're getting screens,
We're getting interference.

1449
02:17:48,914 --> 02:17:50,177
Losing control of the stick.

1450
02:17:50,281 --> 02:17:54,204
We've got flashes.
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1451
02:17:54,279 --> 02:17:58,983
There's a turbulence in the gravity.

1452
02:18:03,666 --> 02:18:06,586
Computers going down.

1453
02:18:18,227 --> 02:18:21,459
The gravitational pull, we're losing control of the stick.

1454
02:18:54,465 --> 02:18:56,623
Murph! Murph, come on!

1455
02:21:03,486 --> 02:21:04,568
Murph!

1456
02:21:14,975 --> 02:21:17,101
Murph! Murph! Murphhh!

1457
02:21:25,673 --> 02:21:26,049
Murph!

1458
02:21:33,464 --> 02:21:36,664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!

1459
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:38,148
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

1460
02:21:39,155 --> 02:21:40,273
No, no!

1461
02:22:39,479 --> 02:22:43,435
If you're leaving just go!
- No.

1462
02:22:44,408 --> 02:22:48,163
No, don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!

1463
02:22:50,543 --> 02:22:56,987
Morse, Morse, Morse.

1464
02:22:57,107 --> 02:22:57,843
'S'

1465
02:23:04,074 --> 02:23:04,827
'T'

1466
02:23:08,102 --> 02:23:10,562
'A'

1467
02:23:11,408 --> 02:23:12,580
'-'

1468
02:23:14,464 --> 02:23:16,758
'-'

1469
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:21,403
Murph, we don't have time for this, come on!

1470
02:23:27,302 --> 02:23:28,400
STAY!

1471
02:23:38,677 --> 02:23:49,271
Come on, come on, Murph, Murph, come on.
What's it say? What's it say? What's it say?

1472
02:23:56,477 --> 02:23:57,449
It says STAY.

1473
02:24:33,132 --> 02:24:35,883
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

1474
02:24:38,264 --> 02:24:41,069
Make him, make him stay Murph.

1475
02:24:45,351 --> 02:24:46,897
STAY

1476
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:51,595
Make him stay Murph!

1477
02:24:52,822 --> 02:24:55,409
Don't let me leave Murph!

1478
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:01,456
Don't, DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!

1479
02:25:06,267 --> 02:25:08,720
NO, NO, NO, NOOO!

1480
02:25:29,736 --> 02:25:31,427
It was you.

1481
02:25:42,602 --> 02:25:45,087
You were my ghost.

1482
02:25:56,697 --> 02:26:00,450
Cooper, Cooper come in.
- TARS?

1483
02:26:00,607 --> 02:26:02,041
Roger that.

1484
02:26:03,414 --> 02:26:06,608
You survived?
- Somewhere...

1485
02:26:06,725 --> 02:26:10,935
...in their fifth dimension.
They saved us.

1486
02:26:11,052 --> 02:26:14,576
Yeah? Well who the hell is 'They'?

1487
02:26:14,687 --> 02:26:16,813
And just why would they want to help us?

1488
02:26:16,894 --> 02:26:19,979
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1489
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:24,716
...inside their five dimensional
reality to allow you to understand it.
- Yeah well it ain't working.

1490
02:26:24,792 --> 02:26:30,909
Yes it is. You've seen that time,
is represented here as a physical dimension.

1491
02:26:31,029 --> 02:26:35,585
You've worked out that you can exert a force
across spacetime.
- Gravity...

1492
02:26:36,629 --> 02:26:39,246
...to send a message?
- Affirmative.

1493
02:26:41,187 --> 02:26:43,157
Gravity...

1494
02:26:43,273 --> 02:26:47,731
...can cross the dimensions, including time?

1495
02:26:48,006 --> 02:26:49,268
- Apparently.

1496
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:56,974
Do you have the quantum data?
- Roger, I have it.

1497
02:26:57,084 --> 02:27:00,421
I've been transmitting it on all wavelengths...

1498
02:27:00,422 --> 02:27:04,583
...but nothing is getting out Cooper.
- I can do this, the answer.

1499
02:27:04,632 --> 02:27:09,266
But such complicated data to a child?
- Not just any child.

1500
02:27:11,106 --> 02:27:12,937
Come on dad!

1501
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,736
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1502
02:27:17,807 --> 02:27:21,498
Even though you communicate it here,
she won't understand it's significance for years!

1503
02:27:21,661 --> 02:27:26,530
No, no, I get that TARS, but
we've got to figure something out alright...

1504
02:27:26,642 --> 02:27:29,273
...or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think, think, think!

1505
02:27:29,546 --> 02:27:33,152
Cooper, they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

1506
02:27:36,818 --> 02:27:41,717
Say that again.
- They didn't bring us here, to change the past.

1507
02:27:45,929 --> 02:27:48,737
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1508
02:27:53,860 --> 02:27:54,812
We brought ourselves.

1509
02:28:03,975 --> 02:28:08,385
TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA, in binary.

1510
02:28:08,512 --> 02:28:10,843
In binary, roger, translating data.

1511
02:28:34,544 --> 02:28:37,316
It's not a ghost.

1512
02:28:38,254 --> 02:28:42,761
It's gravity.
- Don't you get it yet TARS?

1513
02:28:42,874 --> 02:28:44,714
I brought myself here!

1514
02:28:45,211 --> 02:28:49,161
We're here to communicate,
with the three dimensional world.

1515
02:28:49,698 --> 02:28:50,998
We're the bridge!

1516
02:28:58,177 --> 02:29:01,272
I thought they chose me.

1517
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:07,908
But they didn't choose me, they chose her!
- For what Cooper?

1518
02:29:10,402 --> 02:29:12,021
To save the world!

1519
02:29:16,058 --> 02:29:20,185
All of this, in one, little girl's bedroom.

1520
02:29:20,297 --> 02:29:22,719
Every moment, it's infinitely complex.

1521
02:29:22,826 --> 02:29:25,819
They have access to infinite time and space...

1522
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:27,448
...but they're not bound by anything!

1523
02:29:27,577 --> 02:29:32,327
They can't find, a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1524
02:29:32,443 --> 02:29:36,100
That's why I'm here.
- I'm gonna find a way...

1525
02:29:36,124 --> 02:29:39,256
...to tell Murph,
just like I found this moment.
- How Cooper?

1526
02:29:39,372 --> 02:29:40,928
Love TARS, love!

1527
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:44,634
It's just like Brand said,
my connection with Murph, it is quantifiable.

1528
02:29:44,742 --> 02:29:47,245
It is the key. -Why didn't you mention it?

1529
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:50,342
I didn't know the truth.

1530
02:29:52,859 --> 02:29:54,621
The watch!

1531
02:29:57,655 --> 02:30:01,319
The watch!

1532
02:30:03,555 --> 02:30:06,714
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

1533
02:30:10,139 --> 02:30:14,135
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and give it to me.

1534
02:30:14,208 --> 02:30:17,565
Translating the data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1535
02:30:18,903 --> 02:30:22,533
She will. She will.

1536
02:30:24,153 --> 02:30:27,935
He's coming Murph!

1537
02:30:29,052 --> 02:30:34,030
Okay, coming down!
- How do you know?

1538
02:30:37,489 --> 02:30:39,255
Because I gave it to her!

1539
02:30:43,902 --> 02:30:47,360
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,

1540
02:30:50,206 --> 02:30:55,093
Dot, dot, dash, dot,

1541
02:30:55,168 --> 02:30:57,405
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1542
02:30:57,481 --> 02:31:02,161
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1543
02:31:02,236 --> 02:31:05,183

1544
02:31:22,073 --> 02:31:25,995
It was really him!

1545
02:31:26,108 --> 02:31:29,418
All the time
I knew it was him!

1546
02:31:29,504 --> 02:31:31,687
Dad's gonna save us!

1547
02:32:10,146 --> 02:32:11,357

1548
02:32:14,946 --> 02:32:17,570
Eureka!

1549
02:32:20,022 --> 02:32:21,930
It's traditional.

1550
02:32:26,042 --> 02:32:27,805
Eureka!

1551
02:32:32,559 --> 02:32:35,955
Did it work?
- I think it might have.

1552
02:32:37,325 --> 02:32:38,981
How do you know?

1553
02:32:39,061 --> 02:32:42,505
Because, the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

1554
02:32:46,333 --> 02:32:48,345
Don't you get it yet TARS?

1555
02:32:48,418 --> 02:32:51,729
They're not beings.

1556
02:32:51,805 --> 02:32:53,495
They're us!

1557
02:32:55,009 --> 02:32:58,781
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1558
02:32:58,896 --> 02:33:02,775
For all of us.
- Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1559
02:33:02,851 --> 02:33:07,388
No, no. Not yet. But one day.

1560
02:33:07,539 --> 02:33:11,416
Not you and me. But a people.

1561
02:33:11,488 --> 02:33:17,138
A civilization that's evolved
past the 4 dimensions that we know.

1562
02:33:22,693 --> 02:33:23,805
What happens now?

1563
02:34:26,773 --> 02:34:27,638
Mr. Cooper.

1564
02:34:32,281 --> 02:34:36,069
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

1565
02:34:36,181 --> 02:34:38,949
Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.

1566
02:34:39,059 --> 02:34:41,502
Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.

1567
02:34:48,539 --> 02:34:50,155
Take it slow sir.

1568
02:34:51,614 --> 02:34:53,128
You were, um, extremely lucky.

1569
02:34:53,236 --> 02:34:57,513
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1570
02:35:09,516 --> 02:35:12,290
Where am I?

1571
02:35:14,204 --> 02:35:15,787
Cooper station.

1572
02:35:17,050 --> 02:35:18,713
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1573
02:35:19,947 --> 02:35:22,690
Cooper station?

1574
02:35:25,448 --> 02:35:27,887
Well nice of you to name it after me.

1575
02:35:30,942 --> 02:35:34,526
What?
- Well, the station isn't named after you sir,

1576
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,100
It's uh, it's named after your daughter.

1577
02:35:36,115 --> 02:35:40,539
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.
- Is she still alive?

1578
02:35:40,613 --> 02:35:44,477
She'll be here in a couple of weeks.

1579
02:35:45,567 --> 02:35:48,817
She is far too old to be
transferred from another station...

1580
02:35:48,891 --> 02:35:51,122
...but when she heard that you'd been found.

1581
02:35:51,229 --> 02:35:54,756
Well this is, this is
Murphy Cooper we're talking about.

1582
02:35:54,867 --> 02:35:56,741
Yes it is.

1583
02:35:59,222 --> 02:36:01,244
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple of days.

1584
02:36:04,301 --> 02:36:06,869
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.

1585
02:36:07,522 --> 02:36:12,396
I actually uhh, did a paper on you,
in high school,

1586
02:36:12,504 --> 02:36:14,132
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1587
02:36:15,931 --> 02:36:18,632
Oh yeah, Brand.

1588
02:36:20,004 --> 02:36:26,365
Sir, if you could follow me?
You've got a really good situation.

1589
02:36:30,147 --> 02:36:33,537
So um, when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

1590
02:36:34,873 --> 02:36:37,817
I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.

1591
02:36:44,438 --> 02:36:48,200
Well of course, I didn't speak to her in person.

1592
02:36:52,429 --> 02:36:57,313
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1593
02:36:57,422 --> 02:37:00,641
Anyway, there just wasn't enough food.

1594
02:37:00,753 --> 02:37:06,727
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

1595
02:37:07,021 --> 02:37:09,284
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1596
02:37:09,358 --> 02:37:12,302

1597
02:37:12,412 --> 02:37:16,944

1598
02:37:17,025 --> 02:37:19,677
She did confirm, just how much you loved farming.

1599
02:37:19,758 --> 02:37:22,141
She did? Did she?

1600
02:37:22,215 --> 02:37:25,529
Well, home sweet home!

1601
02:37:25,601 --> 02:37:29,229
Everything is in its place and
faithfully reproduced.

1602
02:37:29,310 --> 02:37:30,695
Yes.

1603
02:37:35,244 --> 02:37:40,517
Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine
we found out near Saturn when we found you, yes.

1604
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:43,994
It's power source is shot,
but we can get another one if you want.

1605
02:37:44,103 --> 02:37:45,863
Yes, please!

1606
02:37:47,126 --> 02:37:47,908
Settings.

1607
02:37:49,105 --> 02:37:50,053
General settings.

1608
02:37:51,097 --> 02:37:52,280
Security settings.

1609
02:37:54,408 --> 02:37:57,423
Honesty, new setting.

1610
02:37:58,658 --> 02:38:03,518
95 %
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1611
02:38:03,592 --> 02:38:08,272
Humor: 75 %

1612
02:38:08,382 --> 02:38:09,935
Confirmed.

1613
02:38:10,046 --> 02:38:14,053
Auto self destruct T minus 10, 9...

1614
02:38:14,158 --> 02:38:15,740
Let's make that 60 %.

1615
02:38:17,514 --> 02:38:20,317
60 % confirmed.

1616
02:38:20,390 --> 02:38:24,138
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

1617
02:38:28,503 --> 02:38:30,503
Is this really what it was like?

1618
02:38:32,845 --> 02:38:35,549
It was never this clean slick.

1619
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:44,793
I don't care much for this, pretending
we are back where we started.

1620
02:38:45,622 --> 02:38:47,853
I want to know where we are?

1621
02:38:48,978 --> 02:38:51,309
Where are we going?

1622
02:38:56,183 --> 02:38:58,645
Mr Cooper. -Yes?
- The family is all in there.

1623
02:38:58,802 --> 02:39:00,433
Family?

1624
02:39:00,544 --> 02:39:04,392
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

1625
02:39:37,034 --> 02:39:39,800
You told them I liked farming?

1626
02:39:45,241 --> 02:39:46,393
It was me Murph.

1627
02:39:48,839 --> 02:39:51,250
I was your ghost.

1628
02:39:52,300 --> 02:39:53,774
I know.

1629
02:39:55,901 --> 02:40:01,545
People didn't believe me,
they thought that I was doing it all myself. But...

1630
02:40:04,721 --> 02:40:07,134
...I knew who it was.

1631
02:40:11,277 --> 02:40:13,368
Nobody believed me.

1632
02:40:13,487 --> 02:40:16,431
But I knew you'd come back.

1633
02:40:18,234 --> 02:40:19,849
How?

1634
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:25,150
Because my dad promised me.

1635
02:40:31,540 --> 02:40:35,642
I'm here now Murph.
I'm here.

1636
02:40:37,450 --> 02:40:44,894
No. No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

1637
02:40:47,028 --> 02:40:51,166
I have my kids here for me now.

1638
02:40:53,436 --> 02:40:55,505
You can go.

1639
02:40:58,058 --> 02:40:58,994
Where?

1640
02:41:02,352 --> 02:41:04,479
Brand.

1641
02:41:13,505 --> 02:41:16,299
She's, out there.

1642
02:41:20,863 --> 02:41:23,829
