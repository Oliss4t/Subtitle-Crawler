I N T E R S T E L L A R

3
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:23,203
My dad was a farmer.

4
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:27,270
Like everybody else back then.

5
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:31,125
Of course he didn't start that way.

6
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,607
The computer says you're too tight.

7
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,568
It is under control.
-Crossing the Straits.

8
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,226
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
-Heyyy.

9
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:50,279
Deleting all.
-Hey, we do not have to delete anything.

10
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,339
Dad?

11
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:04,747
Sorry Murph. Go back to bed.

12
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,458
I thought you were the ghost.

13
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:13,082
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
-Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

14
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,854
No, I think it's because
grandpa is too close to...

15
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,530
...being one himself. Go back to bed.

16
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,577
Were you dreaming about the crash?

17
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,465
Get your butt back in bed murph.

18
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:54,068
The wheat had died.

19
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:58,224
The blight came and we had to burn it.
We still had corn.

20
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:03,141
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,317
I guess I can't describe.
It was just constant.

22
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:12,801
Just that, steady blow of dirt.

23
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,245
We wore strips of sheet...

24
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:22,312
...sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

25
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,216
Well when we set the table we always
set the plate upside down.

26
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,938
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside down.

27
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:40,494
Shake a leg. Murph, let's get a move on.
-One o'clock today, you and me in the barn.

28
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,146
Herbicide Resistance 101, check?
-Yes sir.

29
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,059
Not at the table Murph!

30
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,761
Dad, can you fix this?

31
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,189
What the heck did you do to my lander?
-It wasn't me.

32
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,945
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
-It knocked it off my shelf.

33
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,753
It's also knocking the books off.
-There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

34
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,030
Hey.
-I looked it up, it's called a poltergeist.

35
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,740
Dad, tell her.
-Well, that's not very scientific Murph.

36
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:10,637
You said that science was about admitting what we don't know.
-She's got you there.

37
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,841
Hey, start looking after all our stuff.

38
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,580
Coop.

39
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:20,373
Ok. Murph, you wanna talk science.

40
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:24,846
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you gotta go further.

41
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,079
You have to record the facts, analyze...

42
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:31,391
...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions.
Deal?

43
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,765
Deal.
-All right.

44
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:38,292
Have a good day at school.
-Hold up.

45
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:42,636
Parent-Teacher conferences, parent,
not grandparent.

46
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,625
Slow down turbo.
That's not a dust storm.

47
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:52,708
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
-Blight?

48
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:57,364
They say it's the last harvest for okra.
Ever.

49
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:04,147
He should have planted corn like the rest of us.
-Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.

50
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,603
She's single.
-Now what is that supposed to mean?

51
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:09,977
Repopulating the Earth.
-Start pulling your weight young man.

52
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:14,176
Why don't you start minding your own business?
-Old man.

53
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:22,767
All right Murph give me second.

54
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,771
Aha, third.

55
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:32,707
Find a gear dumbass.
-Grind it! -Shut up Tom!

56
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,504
Whatcha do Murph?
-Ahh, she didn't do nothing.

57
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:40,172
Blew a tire is all.
-Murphy's Law.
-Shut up!

58
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:43,076
Grab the spare Tom.
-That is the spare.

59
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:46,278
Get the patch kit.

60
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,895
And how am I supposed to patch it out here?

61
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,372
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always
gonna be here to help you.

62
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:03,767
What's goin' on Murph?

63
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:08,567
Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad?
-No we didn't?

64
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,473
Murphy's Law?

65
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,721
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...

66
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,637
...will happen.
What it means is whatever can happen...

67
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:21,346
...will happen.
And that sounded just fine with us.

68
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,131
Get in.

69
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:31,838
Get in, let's go.

70
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,701
What about the flat tire?

71
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,223
Yes.

72
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:58,208
It is an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,221
Take the wheel Tom.

74
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:07,366
Go, go go!

75
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,075
Keep it pointed at that.

76
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:20,007
Faster Tom, we're losing it.
-Yes.

77
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,956
Point right at it.

78
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,361
Hang on, here we go, here we go.

79
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,405
Nice driving Tom.

80
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,280
Dad?
-Almost have it, don't stop, don't stop.

81
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,332
Dad!
Tom!!!

82
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:58,092
What? You told me to keep driving.

83
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:03,566
Well I guess that answers the ol' 'if I ask you to
drive off a cliff' scenario.

84
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:09,662
We lost it.
-No we didn't!

85
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:24,010
Wanna give it a whirl?

86
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:42,400
Let's land it down there,
right at the edge of the reservoir.

87
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,082
Nicely done!

88
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,975
How long do you think it's been up there?

89
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:56,925
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours, 10 years ago.

90
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,701
So for 10 years?

91
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:05,354
Why did it come down so low?
-I don't know.

92
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,604
Maybe the sun cooked it's brain
or it was looking for something.
-What?

93
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,150
Give me that large flatblade
Maybe some kind of signal.

94
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,441
I don't know.

95
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:21,073
What are you gonna do with it?

96
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:25,009
I'm gonna give it something socially
responsible to do...

97
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:29,574
...like driving a combine.
-Can't we just, let it go?

98
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:33,027
It wasn't hurting anybody.

99
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,172
Listen, this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph,
like the rest of us.

100
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:46,989
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
-I've got class.

101
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,554
This one, needs to wait.

102
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:53,782
What did you do?

103
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,353
Well am I gonna be mad?
-Not with me.

104
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,756
Just please, try not to.

105
00:09:57,872 --> 00:10:01,766
Relax. I got this.

106
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:09,647
You're late Coop.
-Yeah, we had a flat.

107
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:13,684
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

108
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:17,034
No actually sir, that's, that's
a surveillance drone.

109
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:20,947
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
-Take a seat.

110
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:27,241
So, we got Tom's scores back.

111
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:32,074
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
-Yeah he's got a knack for it.

112
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,448
What about college?

113
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,808
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

114
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,800
-I still pay my taxes.
Where does that money go? There's no more armies.

115
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:44,802
Well, they don't go to the university.

116
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:47,655
Look Coop, you have to be realistic.

117
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:52,133
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

118
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,788
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
-What's your waistline?

119
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,650
How about 32, 33 inseam?
-I'm not sure I see where you're getting at.

120
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,896
You're telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass...

121
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,348
...but only one to measure my son's future?

122
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,058
Come on, you're a well-educated man Coop...

123
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,407
...and a trained pilot.
-And an engineer.

124
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:17,264
Okay well right now, we don't need more engineers.

125
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:22,341
We didn't run out of television screens or
planes; we ran out of food.

126
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:26,813
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers like you, and Tom.

127
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:31,652
Uneducated farmers.
-We are a caretaker generation Coop.

128
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,473
And things are getting better.
Maybe your grandkids will get to be...

129
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:36,196
-Are we done here sir?

130
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:41,678
No.
Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.

131
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:46,655
Murph is a great kid, she's really bright.
But she's been having a bit of trouble lately.

132
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:51,100
She brought this in to show the other students.
The section on the lunar landings.

133
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:55,631
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

134
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,633
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

135
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,477
Corrected?
-Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...

136
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:05,669
...the Soviet Union.

137
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,187
You don't believe we went to the Moon?

138
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:18,693
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda
that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...

139
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:22,328
...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.

140
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,876
Useless machines?

141
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:27,864
And if we don't want a repeat of the
excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...

142
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,721
...then we need to teach our kids about this planet.
Not tales of leaving it.

143
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,421
Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make
was called an MRI.

144
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:40,033
And if we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

145
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:44,064
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died; instead of afterwards.

146
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:47,837
And then she would have been the one sitting here
listening to this instead of me...

147
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:52,604
...which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

148
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,851
I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.

149
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,404
But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...

150
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,809
...over this Apollo nonsense.

151
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:05,955
So we thought it would be best to bring you in
and see what ideas you might have...

152
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,765
...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.

153
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,536
Yeah, you know what,
there's a game tomorrow night.

154
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,419
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase,
her favorite team is playing.

155
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:18,089
There's gonna be candy and soda...

156
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,976
...I think I'll take her to that.

157
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,980
How did it go?
-I got you suspended.

158
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,247
What??
-Cooper.

159
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:40,925
This is Cooper, go.
-Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.

160
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:45,651
Just reset the controls.
-I did that, but you should come take a look.

161
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,758
One by one they just teared off the fields
and headed over.

162
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,573
something's interfering with the compass.

163
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:15,134
Magnetism. Or something such.

164
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:02,003
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

165
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:05,344
I counted the spaces.
-Why?

166
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:11,834
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

167
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,624
Morse?
-Yeah, dots and dashes. It's...

168
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,999
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

169
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,222
...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.

170
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:37,104
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset off the anomaly.

171
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:40,015
Which is?
-I don't know.

172
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:43,850
If the house had been built
on magnetic ore...

173
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:46,730
...we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

174
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,694
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

175
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:59,182
You heard?
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.

176
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:04,145
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

177
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:10,882
When I was a kid, it felt like
they made something new everyday.

178
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:14,121
Some gadget or idea.

179
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:18,875
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6 billion people,

180
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,864
just try to imagine that.

181
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:25,219
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

182
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,178
This world isn't so bad.

183
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:36,548
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

184
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:39,318
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

185
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,779
My daughter knew it. God bless her.

186
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:46,664
And your kids know it,
especially Murph.

187
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,086
Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder

188
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:53,483
at our place in the stars.

189
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,774
Now we just look down,

190
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,847
and worry about our place in the dirt.

191
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:03,397
Cooper, you were good at something,

192
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:07,071
and you never got a chance to do anything with it.

193
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,906
I'm sorry.

194
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:14,320
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

195
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:18,222
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

196
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:23,212
In April I believe if I'm right,
15th of April I think.

197
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:27,671
This just happened at 1:30 when that thing
came off the top of the canyon.

198
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:33,025
In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?

199
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,835
Well in my day, people were too busy...

200
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,247
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

201
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:43,149
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

202
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,567
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.

203
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,679
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

204
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:53,570
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

205
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:58,320
Grandpa said huh?
Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.

206
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:02,573
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

207
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,706
And you're gonna be great at it.

208
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:19,134
Let's get outta here.

209
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:31,138
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang, lets mask up.

210
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,255
Tom, Murph? -Check.
-Check?

211
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,198
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

212
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,543
Murph.

213
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,117
The ghost.
-Grab your pillow.

214
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:05,570
You're sleeping with Tom.

215
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,336
It's not a ghost.

216
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:08,990
It's gravity.

217
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:13,483
I'm dropping Tom, then heading into town.

218
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:17,917
You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.

219
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,917
It's not Morse Murph, it's binary.

220
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:48,441
Thick is 1, thin is 0.

221
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,734
Coordinates.

222
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:11,911
That's it.
-I can't miss this.

223
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:14,572
Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.

224
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,627
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

225
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:23,542
And that, is why I can't take you.

226
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,671
Murph.

227
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,081
Grandpa will be home in a while, tell
him I'll call him on the radio.

228
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,195
Jesus!
What are you doing?

229
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:48,909
Oh do you think it's funny? Huh?

230
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,814
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

231
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:56,231
Make yourself useful.

232
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:00,253
Hey Murph.

233
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,952
Murph.

234
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,857
I think this is the end of the road.

235
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,357
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

236
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:16,604
That's my girl.

237
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,617
Step away from the fence.
-Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

238
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:48,981
My daughter is in the car.

239
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:56,223
Don't be afraid.

240
00:25:08,938 --> 00:25:13,150
How did you find this place?
-Where is my daughter?

241
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:17,518
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
Where did you get those coordinates?

242
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:21,378
Where is my daughter?
-Don't make me take you down again, sit down!

243
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,434
Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?

244
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:26,848
Marines don't exist. And you know what?

245
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:30,662
I have got grunts like you mowing my grass.

246
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:34,848
Where did you find those coordinates?
-Unless you want to end up as a lawnmower...

247
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:39,721
...I think I'll turn you into a fabulous dry cleaner.
No you won't.

248
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:43,686
TARS, back down please.

249
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:48,018
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

250
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:52,202
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

251
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:54,219
It's what the government could spare.

252
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:58,815
Who are you?
-Dr. Brand.

253
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:03,785
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a Professor.
-What makes you think I'm not?

254
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,494
Wasn't near as cute either.

255
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:09,350
Please Dr. Brand, I don't have
any idea what this is.

256
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:12,629
But I'm scared for my daughter,
and I want her by my side.

257
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,228
You give me that, and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

258
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,797
Take the principal and the girl
to the conference room.

259
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:25,849
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

260
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:30,461
Must have a very smart mother.
-It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

261
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:34,878
Why don't you let us back up from your fence
and we'll be on our way, huh?

262
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:37,801
It's not that simple.
-Well, sure it is.

263
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:40,899
Look I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

264
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:43,239
Yes you do.

265
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:50,003
Dad!

266
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:54,230
Hello Cooper.

267
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,718
Professor Brand.

268
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,684
Explain to me how you found this facility.

269
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:04,220
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

270
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,851
You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.

271
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:09,757
Nobody stumbles in here, nobody stumbles out.

272
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:14,698
Cooper, please, cooperate with these people.

273
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:19,013
Well, it's kinda hard to explain.

274
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:23,122
We, we learnt these coordinates...

275
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:25,763
...from an anomaly.
-What sort of anomaly?

276
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:29,699
I hesitate to term it supernatural
but it wasn't scientific...

277
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:34,650
You're gonna have to be specific
Mr. Cooper, right now.
-It was gravity.

278
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:42,412
Um what sort of gravitational
an- where was this thing?

279
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:45,908
Hey, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity bud, but...

280
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:50,478
...you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.
-Assurances? -Yeah.

281
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,510
Like that we're getting out of here, and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

282
00:27:56,867 --> 00:28:01,349
Don't you know who we are Coop?
-No Professor, I don't.

283
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:05,059
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

284
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,079
NASA.
-NASA.

285
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:11,744
The same NASA, you flew for.

286
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:25,530
I heard they shut you down sir,
for refusing to drop bombs from...

287
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:28,048
...the stratosphere on the starving people.

288
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,764
When they realized that killing other people...

289
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:35,299
...was not a long term solution,
they needed us back.
In secret.

290
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:39,930
Why secret?
-Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

291
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:42,765
Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.

292
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:48,159
Blight. Wheat, seven years ago.

293
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:51,434
Okra, this year.
-Now, there's just corn.

294
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:54,145
And we're growing more than we ever had.

295
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:58,605
Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

296
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:03,397
...the corn will die. Soon.

297
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:12,262
We'll find a way, Professor, we always have.

298
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:17,164
Driven by the unshakeable faith
that the Earth is ours.

299
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,296
Well not just ours, no.

300
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:21,824
But it is our home.

301
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:26,475
Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.

302
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:28,515
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

303
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,241
Blight does, and as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

304
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:37,178
The last people to starve, will be the first to suffocate.

305
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:39,577
And your daughter's generation...

306
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:43,347
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

307
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:47,421
Murph is feeling a little tired, and was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office?

308
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:48,952
Yeah, thank you.

309
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:53,003
Okay.

310
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:57,211
Now you need to tell me, what your plan is to save the world?

311
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:02,169
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

312
00:30:07,613 --> 00:30:12,194
Rangers.
-The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.

313
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:16,105
The Endurance.
Our final expedition.

314
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:20,183
You sent people out there looking for a new home?

315
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,185
The Lazarus missions.
-Sounds cheerful!

316
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:27,552
Lazarus came back from the dead.
-Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

317
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:30,087
There's not a planet in our
solar system that could sustain...

318
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:33,569
...life and the nearest
star is over a 1000 years away.

319
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,703
I mean, it doesn't even qualify as futile.

320
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,135
Where did you send them?

321
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:45,004
Cooper, I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

322
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,514
You're the best pilot we ever had.
-I barely left the stratosphere.

323
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,925
This team never left the simulator.

324
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:55,460
We need a pilot, and this is
the mission that you were trained for.

325
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:57,544
What, without even knowing?

326
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,649
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive,
and you were going anyway.

327
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:06,785
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

328
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,393
They chose you.
-Who's 'They'?

329
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:21,213
How long, would I be gone?
-I don't know.

330
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:25,232
Years.
-I've got kids Professor.

331
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:28,505
Get out there and save them.

332
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:35,190
Who's 'They'?
-We started detecting gravitational anomalies,

333
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,044
almost 50 years ago.

334
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,727
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

335
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,004
In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.

336
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:46,411
Yeah, in the Straits.

337
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:50,694
My crash, something tripped my fly-by-wire.

338
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:57,628
Exactly. But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

339
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:01,692
Out near Saturn.
A disturbance of spacetime.

340
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:07,389
Is that a wormhole?
-It appeared 48 years ago.

341
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,597
And it leads where?
-Another galaxy.

342
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:16,060
A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.

343
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,702
Someone placed it there.
-'They'?

344
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:23,934
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

345
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,179
That wormhole let's us
travel to other stars.

346
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:29,452
It came right around when we needed it.

347
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,688
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

348
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:36,701
Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
-You sent probes into that?

349
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:40,381
We sent people into it, 10 years ago.

350
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:43,044
The Lazarus missions.

351
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,784
12 possible worlds, 12 Ranger launches.

352
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:50,129
Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.

353
00:32:50,307 --> 00:32:53,084
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

354
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,361
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

355
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:58,015
But they could use hibernation to stretch that...

356
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:02,120
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

357
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,529
Their mission was to assess their world and...

358
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:08,310
...if it showed potential, then they could send
out a signal and bed down for the long nap...

359
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,743
...wait to be rescued.
-And what if the world didn't show promise?

360
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:14,789
Hence the bravery.

361
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:19,120
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
-No.

362
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,039
Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.

363
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,030
Simple binary pings on an annual basis...

364
00:33:26,126 --> 00:33:30,823
...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
One system shows promise.

365
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:33,192
Well one, that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?

366
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:36,796
One system with 3 potential worlds?

367
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:38,695
Not a long shot.

368
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:44,924
Wait.
So if we find a home...

369
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,889
...then what?
-That's the long shot.

370
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:55,246
There is a plan A, and a plan B.

371
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:59,278
Did you notice anything
strange about the launch chamber?

372
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,465
This entire facility is a centrifuge.

373
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:18,591
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
-Both. The plan A.

374
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:20,214
How do you get it off the ground?

375
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:24,637
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

376
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:29,173
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity
was real.

377
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:33,196
So I started working on a theory and we started...

378
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:36,510
...building this station.
-But you haven't solved it yet.

379
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:39,350
That's why there's a plan B.

380
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,700
The problem is gravity.

381
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,689
How to get a viable amount of human life
off the planet?

382
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,871
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

383
00:34:48,982 --> 00:34:53,217
Over 5000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

384
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:58,834
How would you raise 'em?
-With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.

385
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:02,615
After that, with surrogacy
the growth becomes exponential.

386
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:06,789
In 30 years, we could have
a colony of hundreds.

387
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:10,983
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

388
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:12,154
This will take care of that.

389
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:17,047
Yeah, but what about the people here?
You just, you'd give up on them?

390
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:22,165
My kids?
-That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

391
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:27,747
How far have you got?
-Almost there.

392
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,768
You're asking me to hang everything...

393
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,387
...on an 'almost'.
-I'm asking you to trust me.

394
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,497
Find us a new home.

395
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:45,096
And by the time you return,
I would've solved the problem...

396
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:48,650
...of gravity.
I give you my word.

397
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,621
Go away!

398
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:17,697
Murph.
-Go. If you're leaving just go!

399
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:24,352
This world was never enough for you,
was it Cooper?

400
00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:28,892
What, cause heading out there is what I feel like...
...what I was born to do?

401
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,883
And it excites me?

402
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:35,352
Nah, it does not make it wrong.
-It might.

403
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:39,295
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

404
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:44,324
The 'why' of the thing, that's the foundation.
-And the foundation is solid.

405
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:50,208
We farmers, we sit here every year when...

406
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:54,171
...the rains fail, and we say:
Next year.

407
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:58,380
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.

408
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,198
This world's a treasure Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

409
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:11,721
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

410
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:19,387
Tom will be alright,
but you got to make things right with Murph.
-I will.

411
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:23,442
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.

412
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,889
You have to talk to me Murph.

413
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:40,779
I need to fix this before I go.

414
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,408
Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.

415
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:50,513
After you kids came along, your mom, she
said something to me I never quite understood.

416
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:55,407
She said: Now, we're just here...

417
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,572
...to be the memories for our kids.

418
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,170
I think I now understand what she meant.

419
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,794
Once you're a parent, you become the
ghost of your children's future.

420
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:17,700
You said ghosts didn't exist.

421
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,469
That's right Murph.

422
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:30,469
Look at me.

423
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:35,486
I can't be your ghost right now.

424
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:39,223
I need to exist.

425
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,249
They chose me.

426
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,282
Murph, they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

427
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,779
And that's exactly why you can't go.

428
00:38:55,842 --> 00:39:00,819
I figured out the message.
One word. You know what it is?

429
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:03,530
Murph.
-STAY.

430
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,954
It says STAY dad.
-Murph.

431
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:11,868
You don't believe me!
Look at the books. It says STAY.

432
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:16,380
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
-I'm coming back.

433
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,610
When??

434
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:34,480
One for you.
One for me.

435
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:36,493
When I'm up there in hypersleep,

436
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:40,216
or, or traveling at the speed of light,

437
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:42,856
or, near a black hole,

438
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,306
Time is gonna change for me.

439
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,620
And it's gonna run more slowly.

440
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:51,742
So, when we get back,

441
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:56,575
we're gonna compare.
-Time will run differently for us?

442
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:57,518
Yeah.

443
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:01,769
Maybe by the time I get back,
you and I, we might be the same age.

444
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,436
You and me.
What??

445
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:06,024
Imagine that!

446
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:13,731
Ah, Murph.
-You've no idea when you're coming back!!

447
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:19,003
No idea at all!
-Murph.

448
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:24,324
Murph, don't, don't make me leave like this.
Murph!

449
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:27,100
Don't make me leave like this Murph!!

450
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,882
I love you.

451
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:41,895
You hear me?
I love you forever.

452
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,407
And I'm coming back.

453
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:50,905
I'm coming back.

454
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:11,370
How did it go?
-Well.

455
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:12,921
Very well.

456
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:25,779
I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay?
-Yes. Take care of this place for me. OK?

457
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:29,146
OK?
-Ok.

458
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:35,527
Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
-You mean your truck?

459
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:39,090
I'll make sure they bring it back.

460
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,661
Look after my kids Donald.

461
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:59,282
Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.

462
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:03,993
Dad!
-9 -Dad!!

463
00:42:04,028 --> 00:42:08,467
8, 7.
-DAD!!!

464
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:13,815
6, 5.
Main engines start.

465
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:22,781
4, 3, 2, 1. Booster ignition, and.

466
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:33,511
All engines are good.
Beginning roll program.

467
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:41,064
Prepare for stage one separation.

468
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:43,006
Stage one.

469
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:54,199
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

470
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:59,768
They gave him a humor setting,
to fit in better with his unit.

471
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:04,460
He thinks it relaxes us.
-A giant sarcastic robot.

472
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:09,791
What a great idea!
-I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking, would you like?

473
00:43:09,826 --> 00:43:11,025
That wouldn't be a problem.

474
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:15,230
It will help you get back to the
ship, when I blow you out of the air lock.

475
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:18,270
What's your humor setting TARS?

476
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,276
100% -Let's bring it down to 75 please.

477
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,229
Stage two separation.

478
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,519
All feeds going manual.
-Going manual.

479
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:43,644
Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3.
-Check.

480
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:52,100
Taking control.
-This is handover to you.

481
00:43:55,205 --> 00:43:57,683
ADF check. Over.

482
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:02,378
Back thrusters. Fuel cells 1, 2, 3.

483
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:06,049
100%
ex-mites.

484
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,837
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

485
00:44:17,985 --> 00:44:21,921
Your father.
-We're gonna be spending a lot of time together,

486
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:25,601
-We should learn to talk.
-And when not to.

487
00:44:26,655 --> 00:44:31,478
Just being honest.
-Well you don't need to be that honest.

488
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:36,010
Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
-90%

489
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:37,633
90%?

490
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:41,273
Absolute honesty
isn't always the most diplomatic...

491
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:45,022
...nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings.
-Okay!

492
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:47,478
90% it is Dr. Brand.

493
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:54,532
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

494
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:13,605
Okay taking control.

495
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:19,836
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

496
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:34,655
It's all you Doyle.

497
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:55,691
Nice and easy Doyle, nice and easy.

498
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:03,481
Take us home.

499
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,815
Target locked.

500
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,379
Target locked.
Okay, helmets on.

501
00:46:15,535 --> 00:46:16,433
Good job.

502
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,799
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

503
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:19,342
Cooper, you should have control.
-Control here.

504
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:23,062
Communication with ring module active.

505
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,652
That's initiate.

506
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:48,410
Ready to spin?
-Just a sec.

507
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:02,410
Hello CASE.
-Hello TARS.

508
00:48:03,132 --> 00:48:06,804
Okay, we're all set.
-All right let's do it.

509
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:38,048
30% of spin.

510
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:45,466
One g.

511
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:50,227
How is gravity treating you back there?

512
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:57,143
Romilly, hey you okay?
-Yeah. -You all right?

513
00:48:57,254 --> 00:48:58,126
Yeah, no I just need a minute.

514
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,307
Okay, I think we have some dramamine
in the hibe pad, I'll just go and get that.

515
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:05,690
It'll be in the cryo pack.
Just give me a sec. -Hey Brand?

516
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,321
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

517
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:19,439
Amelia, be safe.

518
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:23,720
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
-I will Dad.

519
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:28,791
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated, two years to Saturn.

520
00:49:28,906 --> 00:49:30,711
That's a lot of Dramamine.

521
00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:33,880
Look after my family will you please, sir?

522
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:37,260
We'll be waiting for you, when you get back.

523
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:42,333
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

524
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:47,771
'Do not go gentle into that good night,'

525
00:49:47,962 --> 00:49:52,664
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day,'

526
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:58,567
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

527
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:03,809
'Though wise men at their end,
know dark is right.'

528
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:06,829
'Because their words had forked no lightning they'

529
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:10,384
'Do not go gentle, into that good night'

530
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,710
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

531
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:41,085
Here, pills.

532
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:48,028
So alone.
-We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

533
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:49,436
I mean them.

534
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,050
It's a perfect planet and we're
not gonna find another one like it.

535
00:50:55,228 --> 00:50:59,579
No, it's not like, looking for a new condo.

536
00:50:59,729 --> 00:51:03,803
The human race is going to be, adrift.

537
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:07,876
Desperate for a rock they can cling to before
running out of breath.

538
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:09,569
We have to find that rock,

539
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,698
and our 3 prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain human life.

540
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:19,902
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

541
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:28,395
Wolf Edmonds is here.
-Tell me about Edmonds.

542
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:31,844
Oh, um, Wolf's a particle physicist.

543
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:36,206
Did any of them had families?

544
00:51:37,614 --> 00:51:40,515
No, no attachments. My father insisted.

545
00:51:40,704 --> 00:51:43,327
Everyone knew the possibility of...

546
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:46,330
...ever seeing another human being.
I hope we can surprise at least 3 of them.

547
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,741
Dr. Mann?
-Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.  He's the best of us.

548
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:53,804
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

549
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,836
...in human history.

550
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:58,238
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.

551
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:01,404
Y'know out there, we would face great odds.

552
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,745
Death. But, not evil.

553
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:08,228
You don't think nature can be evil?

554
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:13,193
No. Formiable, frightening. But, no, not evil.

555
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:18,495
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

556
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:20,481
Just what we take with us then?

557
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:25,349
Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.

558
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:28,532
Even me, huh?
-Y'know what? We agreed, 90%.

559
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:30,842
Don't stay up.

560
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,114
I'll be in a minute.

561
00:52:32,273 --> 00:52:36,418
Just remember Coop, you're literally wasting your breath.

562
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,962
Hey TARS, let's go over that trajectory one more time.

563
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,886
8 months to Mars.
Gravitational slingshot around,

564
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,345
14 months to Saturn.
Nothing has changed on that.

565
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:54,970
Let me ask you something.

566
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,692
Dr. Brand and Edmonds.
-Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

567
00:53:02,568 --> 00:53:07,540
Dr. Brand and Edmonds, they close?
-I wouldn't know.

568
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:10,613
Is that '90% wouldn't know' or '10% wouldn't know'?

569
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,812
I also have a discretion setting Cooper.

570
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:18,177
But not a poker-face slick.

571
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:30,961
Hey guys.

572
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:34,782
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

573
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:37,732
and I just, wanted to give you an update.

574
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:41,745
The Earth looks amazing from here.

575
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:46,035
You can't see any of the dust.

576
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:50,432
I really hope you guys are doin', doin' great.

577
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,325
I know you're gonna get this message,

578
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:57,855
Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you.

579
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,468
Is it him?
-Don't think so Murph.

580
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:10,432
You must be Donald.

581
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:16,314
Hello Murph.
-Why are you in my dad's truck?

582
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:19,127
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

583
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:21,903
He sent you a message.

584
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:27,275
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

585
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:30,802
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

586
00:54:32,244 --> 00:54:39,303
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe I should fan the flame.

587
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:43,979
She's already making fools of her teachers,
well, maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.

588
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:48,513
So where are they?
-Heading for Mars.

589
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:53,014
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

590
00:55:32,315 --> 00:55:36,376
They want me to repeat plant pathology.

591
00:55:36,523 --> 00:55:41,958
It sucks. But, they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

592
00:55:42,424 --> 00:55:45,883
So...alright.
Well, I gotta go Dad.

593
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,145
Hope you're safe up there.

594
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:55,005
Sorry Coop, I asked Murph to say hi.

595
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,016
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

596
00:56:15,278 --> 00:56:16,682
Are you okay Rom?

597
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,603
This gets to me Cooper.
This, this.

598
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:26,200
Millimeters of aluminum protecting us
and then nothing...

599
00:56:26,346 --> 00:56:30,054
...out there for millions of miles, won't kill us in seconds.

600
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:36,048
Did you know that some of
the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...

601
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:40,741
...don't know how to swim?
They don't know, and if they go overboard, it's done.

602
00:56:42,338 --> 00:56:44,578
We are explorers Rom.

603
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:49,132
This is our boat.
Here.

604
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:20,937
This is the, relay probe?
-In orbit around the wormhole.

605
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:23,566
This is the wormhole and every
time we come around...

606
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,416
...we would receive images from
the other side of the foreign galaxy.

607
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:31,015
Like swinging a periscope around.
-Exactly.

608
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:35,030
so we got a pretty good idea,
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

609
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:37,982
Navigationally.

610
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:42,705
Hey guys, looks like we're gonna be
approaching the wormhole in three hours.

611
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:52,721
Hey Coop, can we stop the spinning?

612
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:56,790
Why? -Because we are close enough to see it.

613
00:57:58,304 --> 00:58:00,971
Aha.

614
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:09,403
Look, that's, that's it. That's the wormhole.

615
00:58:09,546 --> 00:58:12,473
Say it, don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

616
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:16,176
Well of course it is.
What you thought it would just be a hole?

617
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:21,107
No. It's just that all the illustrations I've seen they...

618
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:25,117
The illustrations, try to show how it works.

619
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:29,439
So they say you want to go from here, to there.

620
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,078
But this is too far.

621
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:34,884
So a wormhole bends space like this so you...

622
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:38,507
...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.

623
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:43,412
Okay so, to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space...

624
00:58:43,488 --> 00:58:47,785
...into 2 dimensions, which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

625
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:50,952
...a circle.
What's a circle in 3 dimensions?

626
00:58:52,147 --> 00:58:55,314
A sphere.
-Exactly. A spherical hole.

627
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:59,439
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

628
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:04,374
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get outta here in one piece Rom.

629
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:12,791
Any trick to this Doyle?

630
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:15,530
No one knows.

631
00:59:21,971 --> 00:59:24,814
The others made it, right?

632
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:28,638
At least some.

633
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,491
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?

634
01:00:03,638 --> 01:00:06,223
To our galaxy.

635
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:09,478
Here we go.

636
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:45,152
Controls won't work here.
We are passing through the bulk.

637
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:50,090
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions.
All you can do is report and observe.

638
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:02,532
What is that?

639
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:08,597
I think it's 'Them'.
-Distorting spacetime?

640
01:01:09,975 --> 01:01:12,279
Don't. Don't!

641
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,869
What was that?

642
01:01:43,255 --> 01:01:45,378
First handshake.

643
01:01:47,054 --> 01:01:48,322
We're...

644
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,737
We're here.

645
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:14,910
So the lost communications came through.
-How?

646
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:19,985
The relay on this side cached them.
Years of basic data, no surprises there.

647
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:25,480
Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up',
as has Dr. Mann's.

648
01:02:25,515 --> 01:02:29,319
Edmonds went down three years ago.
-Transmitter failure?

649
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:32,313
Maybe.
He was sending the thumbs up until it went dark.

650
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:36,079
But Miller's still looks good though, right?
Because she's coming up fast.

651
01:02:36,191 --> 01:02:38,428
But there's one complication.

652
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:42,577
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

653
01:02:42,648 --> 01:02:45,775
Gargantua?
-It's what we're calling the black hole.

654
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:47,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

655
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:51,194
And Miller's is on the horizon?
-Like a basketball around a hoop.

656
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:53,915
Landing there takes us dangerously close...

657
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:57,185
...and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

658
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:02,820
Maybe I, I could swing around the neutron star...

659
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:05,485
-No no no, it's not that, it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

660
01:03:05,632 --> 01:03:08,920
...slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

661
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:10,683
Well how bad?

662
01:03:10,794 --> 01:03:17,596
Well, every hour we spend on that planet
will be, huh, seven years back on Earth.

663
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:21,804
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

664
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:26,204
Well, we can't just drop down there without...
-Cooper...

665
01:03:26,352 --> 01:03:28,790
We have a mission.
-Yeah Doyle, we have a mission.

666
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:31,437
And our mission, Plan A is to find a planet...

667
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:33,978
...that can habitate the people
that are living on the Earth right now.

668
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:36,714
You can't just think about your family,
now you have to think bigger than that, alright?

669
01:03:36,864 --> 01:03:39,809
I'm thinking about my family
and millions of other families.

670
01:03:39,891 --> 01:03:44,816
Okay, Plan A does not work, if the people
on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

671
01:03:45,686 --> 01:03:49,058
No, it doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

672
01:03:50,754 --> 01:03:55,225
Okay. Cooper's right.
We have to think about time as a resource just like...

673
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,676
...oxygen and food.
Going down there is gonna cost us.

674
01:03:57,858 --> 01:04:04,048
Okay look, Dr. Mann's data is promising, alright,

675
01:04:04,192 --> 01:04:07,670
but it's gonna take us months to get there,
and Edmonds, it's even further.

676
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:10,237
Now Miller hasn't said much.
But what she has said is very promising.

677
01:04:10,387 --> 01:04:13,141
It's water, it's organics.
-You don't find that everyday.

678
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:16,662
No, you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

679
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,038
...that would be spent trying to get back here.

680
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:22,148
Romilly.
-Yeah.

681
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:26,594
How far off of Miller's planet
will we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

682
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:30,876
Well, just back from the cusp.
-Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

683
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,428
Alright. Okay.

684
01:04:33,547 --> 01:04:36,811
This is Gargantua, here's Miller's planet.

685
01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:40,597
Instead of taking the Endurance
in orbit around Miller's planet, which would...

686
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:43,443
...conserve fuel, but we'd lose a lot of time,

687
01:04:43,478 --> 01:04:48,016
what if, what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,
parallel with Miller's planet,

688
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:51,546
outside of it's time shift, to here.
Then we take the Ranger down,

689
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:54,565
we get Miller, we get her samples,
we come back, we analyze, we debrief...

690
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,421
...we're in, we're out, we lose a little fuel.
But we save a lot of time.

691
01:04:58,538 --> 01:05:00,442
That'll work.
-That's good. -There's not gonna...

692
01:05:00,593 --> 01:05:04,340
be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there,
so TARS, you should definitely stay here.

693
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:08,135
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

694
01:05:08,282 --> 01:05:10,591
If we are talking about a couple of years,

695
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:12,868
I could use the time to research gravity,

696
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:15,499
observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

697
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:19,903
TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua,
conserve fuel, minimize thrusting.

698
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:22,427
Make sure we stay in range
from Miller's planet. You got it?

699
01:05:22,545 --> 01:05:25,759
I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand.

700
01:05:30,478 --> 01:05:34,101
You ready CASE? -Yep.
-You don't say much do you?

701
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:39,009
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
-Detach.

702
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:49,187
Romilly, are you reading these forces?
-It's unbelievable.

703
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,622
A literal heart of darkness.

704
01:05:57,504 --> 01:06:01,777
If we could just see the collapsed star inside,

705
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,798
the singularity, we'd solve gravity.

706
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:08,265
We can't get anything from it?
-Nothing escapes that horizon,

707
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:12,317
not even light.
All the answers are there, just no way to see it.

708
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,827
There's Miller's planet.

709
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:17,357
Goodbye Ranger.

710
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:34,549
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

711
01:06:34,629 --> 01:06:38,710
-No.
I'll use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.

712
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:41,849
Air-brake?
-We wanna get down fast don't we?

713
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:45,352
Actually we wanna get there in one piece.
-Hang on.

714
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:47,110
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

715
01:07:02,945 --> 01:07:05,677
We should be using the air-brake.
-Hands up CASE.

716
01:07:05,757 --> 01:07:09,176
The only time I've gone down is
when the machine was easing at the wrong time.

717
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,406
You're gonna get us killed.
-Just like reckless driving.

718
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,323
We're too fast. -I got this.

719
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:23,126
Should I get ready to detach?
-No. I need to feel the air.

720
01:07:27,131 --> 01:07:28,326
Here we go.

721
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:32,574
It's just water.

722
01:07:32,683 --> 01:07:37,430
The stuff of life.
-1200 meters.

723
01:07:37,547 --> 01:07:40,622
Have we located the beacon?
-That I have, can you maneuver?

724
01:07:40,731 --> 01:07:45,534
I'm gonna spiral down, everybody hang on.

725
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:48,855
700.

726
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:53,154
On my cue CASE, on my cue.

727
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,429
500 meters.

728
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:08,056
Now!

729
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:23,381
Very graceful.

730
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:27,873
No, but very efficient.

731
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:32,081
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

732
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,862
Go, go, go, go.
7 years per hour here.

733
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:37,262
Let's make it count.

734
01:09:03,449 --> 01:09:04,336
This way.

735
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:09,055
About 200 meters.

736
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:23,664
Gravity's punishing.
-Been floating through space too long?

737
01:09:23,777 --> 01:09:26,078
130% Earth's gravity.

738
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:28,834
Come on, come on, come on.

739
01:09:30,996 --> 01:09:33,407
There's nothing here.
-should be right here.

740
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:38,537
If the, if the signal's coming from here, then...

741
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:49,128
Her beacon.

742
01:09:57,083 --> 01:10:00,360
Wreckage.
-Where's the rest?

743
01:10:00,433 --> 01:10:02,165
Towards the mountains.

744
01:10:05,483 --> 01:10:07,533
Those aren't mountains.

745
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,395
They're waves.
-What?

746
01:10:15,894 --> 01:10:17,372
Shit.

747
01:10:19,467 --> 01:10:21,588
That one's moving away from us.

748
01:10:26,665 --> 01:10:29,433
We need the recorder.

749
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:42,326
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

750
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,674
I'm not, leaving, without, her data.

751
01:10:46,012 --> 01:10:50,278
Get back here now. There is no time.
The second wave is coming.

752
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:52,866
We are in the middle of a swell.

753
01:10:52,975 --> 01:10:56,752
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

754
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:03,591
Brand get back here now!!

755
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:08,937
Cooper, go, Cooper go, I can't make it. Go!

756
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,270
CASE, go get her.

757
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,634
GO!
-Get up, get up Brand.

758
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:19,494
Go go, go.

759
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:24,350
I'm not gonna make it!
-Yes you are. Yes you are!

760
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,573
Come on CASE has her. Doyle get back here.

761
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:37,821
Dr. Brand.

762
01:11:39,515 --> 01:11:41,275
To the hatch.

763
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,302
Go, go. Go.

764
01:11:52,824 --> 01:11:56,861
Manually overriding inside hatch!

765
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:04,918
Cooper don't!
Cooper don't!

766
01:12:05,081 --> 01:12:06,152
Cooper!

767
01:12:08,001 --> 01:12:11,848
Engines are flooded!
I'll have to shut it down!

768
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:46,644
Oh shit!!

769
01:12:51,428 --> 01:12:52,761
Whoaa!

770
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:27,064
CASE what's wrong?
-Engine's waterlogged, let it drain.

771
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:31,457
Goddamn it!!
I told you to leave me.

772
01:13:31,569 --> 01:13:33,974
-And I told you to get your ass back here!

773
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:37,669
The difference is that one of
us was thinkin' about the mission.

774
01:13:37,778 --> 01:13:39,619
-You were thinking about getting home!!

775
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:45,614
I was trying to do the right thing!
-Can you tell that to Doyle?

776
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:50,504
CASE, how much time?
-45 to an hour.

777
01:13:51,911 --> 01:13:53,626
The stuff of life huh?

778
01:13:54,674 --> 01:13:57,610
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
-A lot.

779
01:13:58,493 --> 01:13:59,308
Decades.

780
01:14:06,503 --> 01:14:09,384
What happened to Miller?
-Judging by...

781
01:14:09,499 --> 01:14:13,307
...the wreckage she was
broken up by waves soon after impact.

782
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:16,878
How's the hell the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

783
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:19,722
Because of the time slippage.

784
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:23,491
On this planet's time she,

785
01:14:23,603 --> 01:14:25,624
she's landed hours ago, she...

786
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:28,653
...she probably just died minutes ago.

787
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:32,609
The data Doyle received was just the initial
status echoing endlessly.

788
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,092
Oh we are not prepared for this.

789
01:14:37,509 --> 01:14:41,784
You eggheads've got the survival skills
of a boy-scout troop.

790
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:44,904
Well we got this far on our brains,
farther than any human in history.

791
01:14:45,224 --> 01:14:49,573
Well not far enough.
And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...

792
01:14:49,574 --> 01:14:50,760
...left on Earth to save.

793
01:14:52,683 --> 01:14:56,242
I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.

794
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:04,875
Is there any possibility?
I dunno, maybe some way, maybe we...

795
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:09,000
...could jump in a black hole
and gain back the years?

796
01:15:09,502 --> 01:15:12,857
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative, okay.

797
01:15:12,965 --> 01:15:15,212
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but,

798
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:19,031
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

799
01:15:19,109 --> 01:15:23,300
The only thing that can move across dimensions,
like time, is gravity.

800
01:15:25,612 --> 01:15:26,939
Okay.

801
01:15:28,809 --> 01:15:31,508
The beings that led us here,

802
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:34,712
they communicate through gravity, right?

803
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:38,786
Could they be talking to us from the future?
-Maybe.

804
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:42,403
Okay, if they can..?
They...

805
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:45,171
...are beings of 5 dimensions!

806
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:48,904
Right, to them, time might be
another physical dimension.

807
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:53,532
To them, the past might be a canyon
they can climb into,

808
01:15:53,638 --> 01:15:58,360
and the future, a mountain that they can climb up,
but to us, it's not! Okay!

809
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:02,376
Look Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

810
01:16:03,674 --> 01:16:05,721
But you knew about relativity.

811
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:09,509
Brand.

812
01:16:13,627 --> 01:16:16,586
My daughter is 10 years old.

813
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:19,962
Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left,

814
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:24,643
You couldn't have told your daughter
that you were going to save the world?
-No.

815
01:16:25,768 --> 01:16:30,476
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear,

816
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,273
And that's you want your children to feel safe,

817
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:40,101
and it rules out telling a 10 year old,
that the world's endin'.

818
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:43,421
Cooper.

819
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:50,543
How long for the engines CASE?
-A minute or two.

820
01:16:50,618 --> 01:16:52,790
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!!

821
01:16:56,473 --> 01:17:01,283
Brand, co-pilot you're up.
CASE, run the cabin's oxygen through the main thrusters.

822
01:17:01,394 --> 01:17:03,346
We're gonna spark it!
-Roger that.

823
01:17:03,459 --> 01:17:04,658
Depressurizing.

824
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,172
Engines up!

825
01:17:40,169 --> 01:17:44,086
Hello Rom!
-I've waited years.

826
01:17:45,236 --> 01:17:46,807
How many, how many years?

827
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:53,416
By now it must be,
23 years, 4 months, 8 days.

828
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,461
Doyle?

829
01:18:05,562 --> 01:18:08,914
I thought I was prepared...I knew the theory...

830
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:11,501
...reality is different.

831
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:13,373
And Miller?

832
01:18:14,678 --> 01:18:16,548
There's nothing here for us.

833
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:24,077
Why didn't you sleep?
-Oh I had a couple of stretches.

834
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,037
I stopped believing that you were coming back.

835
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:29,954
Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.

836
01:18:30,023 --> 01:18:33,017
I learned what I could from the black hole

837
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,488
but I couldn't send anything to your father.

838
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,370
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
-Is he alive?

839
01:18:40,453 --> 01:18:43,416
Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.

840
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,342
We've got years of messages stored.
-Cooper.

841
01:18:50,451 --> 01:18:53,804
Messages span 23 years.

842
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,359
Play from the beginning.

843
01:19:00,732 --> 01:19:05,551
Hey Dad,
Just checkin' in, sayin' hi.

844
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:10,198
Umm, I finished 2nd in school,

845
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:13,906
Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though,

846
01:19:14,055 --> 01:19:17,213
pulled me down,
but second's not bad.

847
01:19:18,364 --> 01:19:20,631
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

848
01:19:22,227 --> 01:19:26,709
Umm, oh, I met another girl dad.

849
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:31,769
I uh, I really think this is the one.

850
01:19:32,286 --> 01:19:34,901
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

851
01:19:38,575 --> 01:19:40,195
Murphy stole grandpa's car,

852
01:19:40,303 --> 01:19:43,971
She crashed it, she's okay though.

853
01:19:44,042 --> 01:19:48,838
Hey Dad.
Look at this!

854
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:53,272
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

855
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:58,528
I wanted to go with Coop, but
Lois says maybe next time.

856
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:01,103
And Doanld says he's already got the 'great' part so,

857
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:03,637
we're not to call him that.

858
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,755
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

859
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:13,815
Goodbye grandpa.

860
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:15,725
Sorry, it's been a while.

861
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:23,016
It's..., what with Jesse and all...

862
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:31,776
Uhh, grandpa died last week.

863
01:20:31,883 --> 01:20:34,548
We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom...

864
01:20:34,549 --> 01:20:37,110
...and Jesse.

865
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:43,018
Which is where we would've buried you,
if you would ever have come back.

866
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:46,468
Murph was there at the funeral.

867
01:20:47,478 --> 01:20:50,130
We don't see her that much, but she came for that.

868
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,067
You're not listening to this, I know.

869
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:04,606
All these messages are just, ... drifting...

870
01:21:04,713 --> 01:21:06,977
out there in the darkness.

871
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:13,179
Lois says that, uh... I have to let you go.

872
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,376
And uh...

873
01:21:16,688 --> 01:21:17,524
...so...

874
01:21:20,082 --> 01:21:24,026
I guess... I'll let you go.

875
01:21:25,076 --> 01:21:27,267
I don't know where you're dad.

876
01:21:27,377 --> 01:21:30,941
But I hope that you're at peace. And...

877
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,559
Goodbye.

878
01:21:45,993 --> 01:21:48,220
Hey Dad.

879
01:21:51,284 --> 01:21:54,202
Hey Murph.
-You son of a bitch!

880
01:21:57,599 --> 01:22:00,899
I never made one of these when you were still responding,

881
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,773
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

882
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:08,013
And then when you went quiet,

883
01:22:10,819 --> 01:22:13,945
it felt like I should've lived with that decision,
and I have,

884
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:20,525
but today is my birthday,

885
01:22:23,818 --> 01:22:27,562
And it's a special one,
because you told me,

886
01:22:30,499 --> 01:22:33,842
you once told me that when you come back...

887
01:22:33,956 --> 01:22:35,869
...we might be the same age.

888
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:40,753
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

889
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:47,019
So it would be a real good time for youto come back!

890
01:22:59,191 --> 01:23:01,660
I didn't mean to intrude,

891
01:23:02,596 --> 01:23:06,748
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
-Because I've never been in here before.

892
01:23:09,124 --> 01:23:13,580
I talk to Amelia, all the time.
It helps.

893
01:23:13,731 --> 01:23:17,803
I'm glad you've started.
-I haven't.

894
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:22,282
Just had something which needed to get out.
-I know they're still out there.

895
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:22,685
I know.

896
01:23:22,802 --> 01:23:27,646
There are many reasons why our communications
might not be getting through.

897
01:23:27,763 --> 01:23:28,944
I know Professor.

898
01:23:29,058 --> 01:23:33,092
I'm not sure, what I'm more afraid of.

899
01:23:33,205 --> 01:23:36,200
Them never coming back or...

900
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:40,351
...coming back to find we've failed.

901
01:23:40,464 --> 01:23:43,861
Then let's succeed.
-So,

902
01:23:43,968 --> 01:23:48,867
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

903
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:52,558
With respect Professor, we've tried that
hundreds of times.

904
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:56,189
-It only has to work once, Murph.

905
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:02,844
Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.

906
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:05,990
We've done well, in the world here,

907
01:24:06,098 --> 01:24:10,155
whether or not we crack the equation,
before I kick the bucket.

908
01:24:10,268 --> 01:24:13,939
Don't be morbid Professor.
-I'm not afraid of death.

909
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:15,810
I am an old physicist.

910
01:24:17,444 --> 01:24:19,096
I'm afraid of time.

911
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,434
Time.

912
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:31,449
You're afraid of time.

913
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,460
For years we've been trying
to solve the equation without changing...

914
01:24:36,547 --> 01:24:39,139
...the underlying assumption about time.
-And?

915
01:24:39,293 --> 01:24:43,252
What it means, is each iteration
is an attempt to prove it's own proof,

916
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:47,200
it's recursive,...it's nonsensical.

917
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,047
Are you calling my life's work nonsense, Murph?

918
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:55,374
No, I'm saying that you've been trying
to finish it with one arm...

919
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:59,190
...no, with both arms tied behind your back.

920
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:02,212
And I don't understand why.

921
01:25:03,325 --> 01:25:05,115
I am an old man Murph.

922
01:25:05,224 --> 01:25:08,751
Can we take this point up another time?

923
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:10,914
I want to talk to my daughter.

924
01:25:12,429 --> 01:25:15,810
Stepping out into the universe,

925
01:25:15,927 --> 01:25:20,050
we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

926
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:24,296
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.

927
01:25:25,557 --> 01:25:28,304
We must think, not as individuals,

928
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:30,614
but as a species.

929
01:25:31,946 --> 01:25:36,937
'Do not go gentle into that good night.'

930
01:25:37,486 --> 01:25:40,588
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed it...

931
01:25:40,663 --> 01:25:43,398
...but the trip took longer than we anticipated.

932
01:25:43,507 --> 01:25:46,334
We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects,

933
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:48,993
so, we've to choose.

934
01:25:50,648 --> 01:25:51,228
But how?

935
01:25:52,595 --> 01:25:54,076
They're both promising.

936
01:25:55,378 --> 01:25:57,769
And Edmonds data is better,

937
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,553
but Dr. Mann is the one still transmitting. So...

938
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:03,474
We've got no reason to suspect Edmonds data would've soured.

939
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:08,804
His world has key elements to sustain human life.
-As does Dr. Mann's.

940
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:10,245
Cooper, this is my field.

941
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:16,245
And I really believe Edmond's is the better prospect.
-Why?

942
01:26:16,358 --> 01:26:21,350
Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

943
01:26:21,461 --> 01:26:25,654
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes;
But no life. Sterile.

944
01:26:25,668 --> 01:26:30,511
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
-Because of the black hole?

945
01:26:30,587 --> 01:26:34,087
-Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen, will happen.

946
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:36,865
Accidents are the first building block of evolution,

947
01:26:37,017 --> 01:26:40,398
but when you're orbiting a black hole,
not enough can happen,

948
01:26:40,513 --> 01:26:44,378
it sucks in asteroids, comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

949
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:45,767
We need to go further afield.

950
01:26:46,516 --> 01:26:52,301
You once said that Dr. Mann, was the best of us.

951
01:26:52,411 --> 01:26:56,058
He is remarkable.
we're only here because of him.

952
01:26:56,165 --> 01:26:59,440
And, and yet here he is,
he is on the ground,

953
01:26:59,588 --> 01:27:04,209
and he's sending a very unambiguous message,
telling us to come to his planet.

954
01:27:05,194 --> 01:27:09,954
-Granted.
But Edmond's data is more promising.

955
01:27:10,027 --> 01:27:13,834
-We should vote.
-Well, if we're gonna vote, there's something you should know,

956
01:27:13,944 --> 01:27:17,447
Brand, he has a right to know.

957
01:27:17,521 --> 01:27:20,953
That has nothing to do with it.
-What does?

958
01:27:21,066 --> 01:27:24,210
She's in love with Wolf Edmonds.
-Is that true?

959
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:25,545
Yes.

960
01:27:28,293 --> 01:27:31,460
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

961
01:27:34,633 --> 01:27:38,678
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure this out with theory,

962
01:27:38,756 --> 01:27:41,881
-You're a scientist Brand.
-So listen to me,

963
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:46,640
When I say that love isn't
something we invented, it's...

964
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:50,314
...observable, powerful.

965
01:27:52,227 --> 01:27:56,933
It has to mean something.
-Love has meaning, yes, social utility...

966
01:27:56,934 --> 01:28:00,521
...social bonding, child rearing,
-We love people who have died,

967
01:28:00,628 --> 01:28:04,565
where's the social utility in that?
-None.

968
01:28:04,676 --> 01:28:07,473
-Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

969
01:28:07,546 --> 01:28:10,566
...yet understand.

970
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:13,977
Maybe it's, some evidence, some...

971
01:28:14,855 --> 01:28:19,626
...artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive,

972
01:28:19,749 --> 01:28:22,651
I'm drawn across the universe to someone...

973
01:28:22,724 --> 01:28:27,351
...I haven't seen in a decade.
Who, I know, is probably dead.

974
01:28:27,462 --> 01:28:30,485
Love is the one thing we're capable...

975
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:33,778
...of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

976
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:38,107
Maybe we should trust that,

977
01:28:38,178 --> 01:28:41,110
even if we can't understand it yet.

978
01:28:44,591 --> 01:28:46,821
Alright Cooper,

979
01:28:49,238 --> 01:28:50,176
Yes!

980
01:28:51,687 --> 01:28:54,895
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

981
01:28:55,116 --> 01:28:59,843
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
-Honestly Amelia,

982
01:29:01,757 --> 01:29:03,122
it might.

983
01:29:08,842 --> 01:29:12,615
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

984
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:37,891
We'll lose about a third again. Next year.
Next year, I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and make it up.

985
01:29:38,004 --> 01:29:39,910
What happened to Nelson?

986
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:50,608
Murph, can I get you anything?
Would you like some more Souffl?
-No, I'm full. Thanks.

987
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:51,583
It was delicious.

988
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,426
Hand me that donut please.

989
01:29:56,551 --> 01:30:00,993
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...

990
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:04,379
-I need to get back.
-My sewing machine is in there, but there's...

991
01:30:04,449 --> 01:30:07,454
-I need to...

992
01:30:08,892 --> 01:30:13,037
...too many memories.
-Well, we have something for that.

993
01:30:21,812 --> 01:30:22,915
Dust.

994
01:30:24,535 --> 01:30:27,811
Lois, I have a friend who could...

995
01:30:27,891 --> 01:30:30,080
...look at his lungs.

996
01:30:48,236 --> 01:30:51,263
Amelia, I'm sorry.
-You're just being objective.

997
01:30:51,335 --> 01:30:54,530
Unless you're punishing me,
for screwing up on Miller's planet,

998
01:30:54,733 --> 01:30:56,737
-No, this wasn't a personal decision.

999
01:30:56,813 --> 01:31:01,272
Well, if you're wrong, you have
a very personal decision to make.

1000
01:31:01,383 --> 01:31:05,415
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1001
01:31:05,524 --> 01:31:08,464
Strike out Mann's planet and you'll
have to decide whether...

1002
01:31:08,539 --> 01:31:12,026
...to return home, or push onto Edmonds with plan B.

1003
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,999
Creating a colony could save us from extinction.

1004
01:31:16,113 --> 01:31:18,853
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

1005
01:31:18,964 --> 01:31:20,901
...or the future of the human race.

1006
01:31:22,052 --> 01:31:23,973
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1007
01:31:30,122 --> 01:31:33,397
He has been asking for you since he came to.

1008
01:31:33,472 --> 01:31:34,770
We were trying to reach you.

1009
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:44,155
Murph?
-Hey.
I'm here Professor.

1010
01:31:44,264 --> 01:31:47,644
I think I let all down.

1011
01:31:47,758 --> 01:31:50,820
No, you got us this far.
We're close.

1012
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:54,399
I will finish what you started.

1013
01:31:54,513 --> 01:31:57,630
Good, good Murph.

1014
01:31:57,744 --> 01:32:01,938
You had faith.

1015
01:32:02,011 --> 01:32:07,484
All those, all those years,

1016
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:12,483
I asked you to have faith,

1017
01:32:13,609 --> 01:32:24,635
I wanted you to believe, that your father would come back.

1018
01:32:25,032 --> 01:32:26,903
I do Professor.

1019
01:32:28,637 --> 01:32:32,559
Forgive me Murph.
-There's nothing to forgive.

1020
01:32:34,467 --> 01:32:39,286
I lied Murph,

1021
01:32:40,405 --> 01:32:42,716
I lied to you.

1022
01:32:48,441 --> 01:32:55,399
There was no need for him, to come back.

1023
01:32:56,570 --> 01:33:01,786
There's no way to help us.

1024
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:05,193
But the Plan A? All this?

1025
01:33:06,029 --> 01:33:10,570
All these people.
And the equation?

1026
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:15,881
Did my father know?

1027
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:21,383
Did he leave me?

1028
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:34,204
'Do....not....go....gentle....'

1029
01:33:34,396 --> 01:33:40,176
No. NO!

1030
01:33:40,294 --> 01:33:44,595
You can't leave.
NO!!

1031
01:33:44,705 --> 01:33:48,801
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1032
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:52,007
He didn't feel any pain. He was at peace.

1033
01:33:52,087 --> 01:33:54,854
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1034
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:09,637
Brand did you know?

1035
01:34:11,154 --> 01:34:13,431
Did he tell you the truth?

1036
01:34:15,032 --> 01:34:17,692
Did you know?

1037
01:34:18,743 --> 01:34:21,191
This was all a sham.

1038
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,444
You left us here.

1039
01:34:28,782 --> 01:34:31,263
To suffocate.

1040
01:34:32,522 --> 01:34:34,354
To starve.

1041
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:03,534
A frozen cloud.

1042
01:37:27,492 --> 01:37:30,756
It's okay.

1043
01:37:36,013 --> 01:37:39,026
It's okay.

1044
01:37:39,144 --> 01:37:41,086
It's okay.

1045
01:37:43,882 --> 01:37:46,167
Pray you never learn,

1046
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:50,522
just how good it can be to see another face.

1047
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:03,997
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

1048
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:08,460
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1049
01:38:10,338 --> 01:38:14,535
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set up a waking date.

1050
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:20,993
You've literally raised me from the dead.

1051
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:23,228
Lazarus.

1052
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:28,372
What about the others?
-I'm afraid you're it sir.

1053
01:38:29,385 --> 01:38:31,302
So far, surely.

1054
01:38:31,878 --> 01:38:34,556
No. In our present situation...

1055
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:37,363
...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.

1056
01:38:40,452 --> 01:38:41,873
Dr. Mann.

1057
01:38:42,243 --> 01:38:45,508
Dr. Mann, tell us about your world.

1058
01:38:48,702 --> 01:38:50,757
Our world, we hope...

1059
01:38:53,146 --> 01:39:02,239
Our world is cold, stark,
but undeniably beautiful.

1060
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:07,488
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1061
01:39:11,378 --> 01:39:15,297
The nights are 67 more colder hours.

1062
01:39:20,302 --> 01:39:26,217
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80% of the Earth's.

1063
01:39:26,331 --> 01:39:29,502
Now here, where I landed,
the water is alkali.

1064
01:39:29,619 --> 01:39:33,316
And the air is too much ammonia
to breathe for more than just a few minutes.

1065
01:39:33,317 --> 01:39:37,996
But, down at the surface, and there is, a surface,

1066
01:39:38,066 --> 01:39:42,643
the chlorine dissipates,
the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

1067
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:45,486
Breathable air, to organics.

1068
01:39:45,596 --> 01:39:48,333
Possibly even, to life.

1069
01:39:48,414 --> 01:39:51,258
We might be sharing this world.

1070
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:53,654
These readings are from the surface?

1071
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:58,487
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
-How far have you explored?

1072
01:39:58,596 --> 01:40:01,547
I have managed several major expeditions,
but with oxygen in...

1073
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:06,567
...limited supply, Kipp there,
really did most of the legwork.
-What went wrong with him sir?

1074
01:40:06,646 --> 01:40:09,471
Degeneration. He misidentified...

1075
01:40:09,472 --> 01:40:14,436
...the first organics we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but...

1076
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:18,405
...ultimately I had to decommission him,
use his power source to keep the mission going.

1077
01:40:18,594 --> 01:40:22,770
I thought I was alone even before I shut him down.
-Would you like me to take a look at him?

1078
01:40:22,842 --> 01:40:26,190
No, no, needs a human touch.

1079
01:40:26,262 --> 01:40:28,511
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message...

1080
01:40:28,512 --> 01:40:32,800
...for you, from the spaceship.
-Okay, be right there. Excuse me.

1081
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,392
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1082
01:40:48,505 --> 01:40:54,199
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1083
01:40:56,516 --> 01:40:58,501
I'm sorry for your loss.

1084
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,714
Is that Murph?
-She's,...she's grown!

1085
01:41:05,787 --> 01:41:06,798
Brand did you know?

1086
01:41:08,206 --> 01:41:09,721
Did he tell you the truth?

1087
01:41:12,063 --> 01:41:14,073
Did you know?

1088
01:41:15,597 --> 01:41:19,851
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

1089
01:41:21,006 --> 01:41:23,669
To suffocate.

1090
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,070
To starve.

1091
01:41:30,777 --> 01:41:32,330
Did my father know too?

1092
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:35,789
Dad!

1093
01:41:38,026 --> 01:41:43,997
I just want to know, if you left me here to die?

1094
01:41:45,157 --> 01:41:48,080
I just have to know!

1095
01:41:53,197 --> 01:42:01,934
Cooper, my father dedicated
his whole life to plan A, I have...

1096
01:42:02,009 --> 01:42:04,131
...no idea what she's talking about.

1097
01:42:05,217 --> 01:42:06,702
I do.

1098
01:42:11,133 --> 01:42:15,017
He, he never even hoped to get the
people off the Earth?

1099
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:16,708
No.

1100
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:24,991
But he has been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1101
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:29,312
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1102
01:42:29,386 --> 01:42:31,302
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1103
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:35,878
The equation couldn't reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics
You need more.

1104
01:42:35,951 --> 01:42:40,574
More? More what?
-More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1105
01:42:40,575 --> 01:42:44,715
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
-Romilly, is that true?

1106
01:42:45,553 --> 01:42:49,793
If the black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1107
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,213
The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...

1108
01:42:52,286 --> 01:42:54,045
...in darkness, beyond the horizon.

1109
01:42:55,136 --> 01:42:57,366
That's why we call it a 'black' hole.

1110
01:42:57,475 --> 01:43:01,700
Okay,...if we were to see beyond the horizon.

1111
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:05,862
You can't Cooper.
-There are some things that aren't meant to be known.

1112
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:10,397
Your father had to find another way to save
the human race from extinction.

1113
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,964
Plan B, a colony.
-But why not tell people?

1114
01:43:15,413 --> 01:43:16,793
Why keep it from us?

1115
01:43:16,907 --> 01:43:19,283
Because he knew how hard it would be
to get people...

1116
01:43:19,284 --> 01:43:24,282
...to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

1117
01:43:24,387 --> 01:43:25,471
Bullshit!

1118
01:43:25,579 --> 01:43:28,324
You never would have here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1119
01:43:28,438 --> 01:43:31,198
Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier.

1120
01:43:31,272 --> 01:43:35,482
We can care deeply, selflessly
about those we know.

1121
01:43:35,553 --> 01:43:39,911
But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
-But the lie?

1122
01:43:43,263 --> 01:43:47,839
That monstrous lie?
-Unforgivable.

1123
01:43:47,951 --> 01:43:52,738
And he knew that.
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity,

1124
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:56,342
in order to save the species,
he made an incredible sacrifice.

1125
01:43:56,456 --> 01:44:00,950
NO! No, an incredible sacrifice is being made,

1126
01:44:01,025 --> 01:44:03,929
by the people on Earth who're gonna die!

1127
01:44:03,936 --> 01:44:08,581
Because in his fucking arrogance,
he declared their case hopeless.

1128
01:44:08,688 --> 01:44:13,145
I'm sorry Cooper,
their case is hopeless.

1129
01:44:13,187 --> 01:44:17,413
No. No.
-we are the future.

1130
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:20,073
Cooper.

1131
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:22,752
Cooper, what I can do?

1132
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:27,509
Let me go home.

1133
01:44:28,016 --> 01:44:30,679
You're absolutely positive?

1134
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:35,297
His solution was correct. He had it for years.
-It's worthless?

1135
01:44:35,368 --> 01:44:36,999
It's half the answer.

1136
01:44:37,585 --> 01:44:41,132
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1137
01:44:41,245 --> 01:44:44,384
Out there, in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

1138
01:44:44,493 --> 01:44:46,007
Yeah?

1139
01:44:47,235 --> 01:44:48,744
I'm not sure you can.

1140
01:44:49,689 --> 01:44:53,589
They just, pack up and leave?

1141
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:58,976
What do they expect to find?
-Survival.

1142
01:45:06,224 --> 01:45:07,555
Damn it!

1143
01:45:10,623 --> 01:45:14,469
Murph, don't, don't people have the right to know?

1144
01:45:14,587 --> 01:45:19,010
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1145
01:45:19,081 --> 01:45:22,300
Yes, but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

1146
01:45:22,408 --> 01:45:25,723
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1147
01:45:26,381 --> 01:45:30,245
So, do you have an idea?

1148
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:32,906
A feeling.

1149
01:45:35,427 --> 01:45:37,849
I told you about my ghost.

1150
01:45:39,404 --> 01:45:43,952
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

1151
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:49,491
But I was never scared of it.

1152
01:45:50,467 --> 01:45:58,205
I called it a ghost because...
it felt like a person,

1153
01:45:59,969 --> 01:46:02,814
that was trying to tell me something.

1154
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:08,184
If there is an answer
here on Earth, it's back there,

1155
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:12,502
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

1156
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:17,978
We're running out of time.

1157
01:46:19,024 --> 01:46:22,154
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1158
01:46:22,261 --> 01:46:25,922
They can stay CASE.
I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway.
-Hey Coop. -Yeah?

1159
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:29,474
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
-What is that?

1160
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:31,459
One last crack at the black hole.

1161
01:46:32,767 --> 01:46:36,269
I'm going home Rom.
-Yeah I know.

1162
01:46:36,376 --> 01:46:41,033
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

1163
01:46:41,111 --> 01:46:44,877
Talk to me.
-Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.

1164
01:46:44,985 --> 01:46:48,200
It has what we call a 'gentle' singularity.
-Gentle?

1165
01:46:48,322 --> 01:46:52,718
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...

1166
01:46:52,825 --> 01:46:57,105
...crossing the horizon fast, might survive.
A probe say.

1167
01:46:57,177 --> 01:46:58,657
What happens after it crosses?

1168
01:46:58,736 --> 01:47:01,618
What is beyond the horizon,
is a complete mystery.

1169
01:47:01,691 --> 01:47:04,487
So, what's to say that there is some
way that the probe can...

1170
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:07,412
...glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1171
01:47:07,542 --> 01:47:11,564
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...

1172
01:47:11,653 --> 01:47:16,508
Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor?
-TARS is the obvious candidate.

1173
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:19,225
I've already told him what to look for.

1174
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:23,555
I'll need the optical transmitter on KIPP, Cooper.
-You would do this for us?

1175
01:47:23,663 --> 01:47:26,504
Before you get all teary,
try to remember that as a robot...

1176
01:47:26,578 --> 01:47:30,190
...I have to do anything you say.
-Your cue light's blinking.

1177
01:47:30,264 --> 01:47:31,680
I'm not joking!

1178
01:47:33,304 --> 01:47:38,029
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1179
01:47:38,099 --> 01:47:41,682
Well, I don't wanna disturb his archival functions.
-I'll supervise.

1180
01:47:41,792 --> 01:47:45,971
Alright.
-Dr. Mann, we need to find 3 secure sites.

1181
01:47:46,051 --> 01:47:48,314
One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.

1182
01:47:48,428 --> 01:47:50,977
When the modules are landed,
you don't wanna move.

1183
01:47:51,077 --> 01:47:53,234
Well I can take you to the probes sites,
but I don't think these...

1184
01:47:53,349 --> 01:47:56,263
...conditions are gonna hold.
We should wait.

1185
01:47:56,374 --> 01:47:59,256
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

1186
01:47:59,339 --> 01:48:01,927
I would like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1187
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:07,437
Well, these squalls usually do blow over.

1188
01:48:07,515 --> 01:48:10,609
Okay then.
-You're gonna need a long-range transmitter.

1189
01:48:10,723 --> 01:48:12,499
Right.
-Are you charged? -Yeah.

1190
01:48:12,581 --> 01:48:13,995
Follow me.

1191
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:18,804
TARS, 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper.

1192
01:48:24,979 --> 01:48:28,033
Brand told me why you've got to go back.

1193
01:48:28,847 --> 01:48:33,625
But I'd be remiss
if I at least didn't mention that a mission...

1194
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:36,862
...such as ours could certainly do
with an extra engineer.

1195
01:48:38,322 --> 01:48:40,666
Oh you better slow down turbo.

1196
01:48:40,778 --> 01:48:45,717
Safety first CASE, do not forget.
-Safety first Cooper.

1197
01:48:45,795 --> 01:48:50,256
I have to tell you Dr. Mann
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1198
01:48:50,369 --> 01:48:52,527
But once we set up
base camp and...

1199
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:56,992
...secure those modules, my work is done here.
I'm going home.

1200
01:49:04,829 --> 01:49:06,556
We have attachments.

1201
01:49:06,632 --> 01:49:10,918
But even without a family,
I promise you that, that yearning...

1202
01:49:11,024 --> 01:49:13,505
...to be with other people is remarkable.

1203
01:49:13,538 --> 01:49:19,581
That emotion is, at the foundation, of what makes us humans.

1204
01:49:28,266 --> 01:49:31,925
How long have you had that cough?
-For a while.

1205
01:49:41,857 --> 01:49:44,156
Mom let's me play in here.

1206
01:49:44,698 --> 01:49:47,034
I don't touch your stuff.

1207
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,733
Just take this gently.

1208
01:50:25,161 --> 01:50:28,619
You know why we couldn't just send
machines on these missions, don't you Cooper?

1209
01:50:28,733 --> 01:50:33,709
A machine doesn't improvise well,
because you can't programme the fear of death.

1210
01:50:33,781 --> 01:50:38,345
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest source of inspiration.

1211
01:50:38,455 --> 01:50:40,447
Take your example,

1212
01:50:41,341 --> 01:50:46,499
A father, with a survival instinct
that extends to his kids.

1213
01:50:46,622 --> 01:50:51,965
What does research tell us, is the
last thing you're gonna see, before you die?

1214
01:50:53,408 --> 01:50:56,798
Your children.
Their faces.

1215
01:50:56,875 --> 01:51:00,976
At the moment of death, your mind
will push you a little bit harder, to survive.

1216
01:51:01,057 --> 01:51:04,642
For them.

1217
01:51:06,737 --> 01:51:10,759
Hey, I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me.

1218
01:51:10,886 --> 01:51:13,328
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.

1219
01:51:13,687 --> 01:51:15,462
OK? -Yes.

1220
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:27,881
TARS, what's taking so long?
-Professor, I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

1221
01:51:27,992 --> 01:51:29,782
I don't understand?

1222
01:51:36,562 --> 01:51:37,755
It's funny.

1223
01:51:39,727 --> 01:51:44,790
When I left Earth,
I thought I was prepared to die.

1224
01:51:45,764 --> 01:51:53,044
The truth is, I never really, considered...

1225
01:51:53,158 --> 01:51:55,455
...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1226
01:51:57,567 --> 01:52:01,659
Nothing turns out as it's supposed to be.
-Let's go.

1227
01:52:06,313 --> 01:52:07,891
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!

1228
01:52:18,002 --> 01:52:20,218
What is this?
-What are you doing??

1229
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:23,683
Sorry, I can't let you leave
with that ship.

1230
01:52:23,765 --> 01:52:26,420
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

1231
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:31,527
Once the others, realize what this place isn't.
We cannot survive here.

1232
01:52:31,604 --> 01:52:33,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1233
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:45,299
They can't stay here anymore.

1234
01:52:45,373 --> 01:52:48,995
You have to leave right now. You understand.
Hey buddy, let me make something abundantly clear...

1235
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:51,837
You have a responsibility.
-Shit.

1236
01:52:51,949 --> 01:52:54,543
Coop, get her stuff.
-Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!

1237
01:52:54,653 --> 01:52:56,723
Daddy do not you were raised to be stupid.

1238
01:52:56,802 --> 01:52:59,099
Dad didn't raise me, grandpa did,
and he's buried...

1239
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:00,614
...out back with mom and Jesse.

1240
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:12,103
All the data?

1241
01:53:12,177 --> 01:53:17,009
No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.

1242
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:21,932
But I knew, the day that I arrived here,
this place had nothing...

1243
01:53:22,008 --> 01:53:26,289
...and I resisted the temptation, for years

1244
01:53:26,364 --> 01:53:34,320
But, I knew that, if I just pressed
that button, probably, somebody would come to save me.

1245
01:53:35,446 --> 01:53:38,825
You fucking coward!
-Yes.

1246
01:53:43,806 --> 01:53:45,208
Yes.

1247
01:53:46,582 --> 01:53:48,129
Yes.

1248
01:53:49,135 --> 01:53:50,069
Yes.

1249
01:54:01,932 --> 01:54:06,685
Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your family go.
Just save your family.

1250
01:54:06,717 --> 01:54:11,574
And go to live underground? With you?
And pray that dad would come to save us?

1251
01:54:11,644 --> 01:54:15,569
Daddy is not coming back. He never was coming back.
It's upto me!

1252
01:54:15,613 --> 01:54:20,477
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad couldn't do it?. -Dad didn't even try!

1253
01:54:20,597 --> 01:54:22,293
Dad just abandoned us!!

1254
01:54:23,483 --> 01:54:27,733
He left us here to die.
-Nobody is going with you.

1255
01:54:31,618 --> 01:54:33,822
You're gonn await for your next kid to die?

1256
01:54:36,851 --> 01:54:40,745
Get out, and don't come back!

1257
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:47,352
Do what you want with those things.

1258
01:54:58,037 --> 01:54:59,740
Stop it!

1259
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:04,061
No. NO!

1260
01:55:04,998 --> 01:55:08,347
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourselves.

1261
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:11,156
Those are the best odds i've had in years!

1262
01:55:31,209 --> 01:55:36,041
Don't judge me Cooper.
You were never tested like I was.

1263
01:55:36,486 --> 01:55:38,414
Very few have.

1264
01:55:46,704 --> 01:55:48,400
You tried your best Murph.

1265
01:55:57,209 --> 01:55:59,123
Do you feel it?

1266
01:56:00,133 --> 01:56:02,431
The survival instinct.

1267
01:56:03,336 --> 01:56:08,011
That's what drove me.
And that is all, that's gonna save us.

1268
01:56:08,087 --> 01:56:11,843
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

1269
01:56:16,963 --> 01:56:20,979
I'm sorry, I can't,
I can't watch you go through this.

1270
01:56:21,055 --> 01:56:23,324
I thought I could, but I can't.

1271
01:56:24,589 --> 01:56:27,054
I'm here, I'm here for you.

1272
01:56:27,161 --> 01:56:30,953
Listen to my voice Cooper, I'm right here.

1273
01:56:32,078 --> 01:56:34,709
You're not alone.

1274
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,049
Do you see your children?

1275
01:56:48,537 --> 01:56:52,661
It's okay.
They are right there with you.

1276
01:56:56,522 --> 01:56:59,802
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem
before you left?

1277
01:56:59,912 --> 01:57:01,606
Do you remember?

1278
01:57:02,833 --> 01:57:07,300
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

1279
01:57:07,413 --> 01:57:13,129
'Old age should burn, and rave
at close of day.'

1280
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:17,821
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

1281
01:57:42,233 --> 01:57:45,127
Help! Help!
-Cooper?

1282
01:57:52,045 --> 01:57:54,864
CASE!
-Brand.

1283
01:57:55,818 --> 01:57:56,694
No air!

1284
01:57:58,726 --> 01:58:02,174
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have his position.

1285
01:58:02,256 --> 01:58:04,590
Come on, come on, come on.

1286
01:58:16,341 --> 01:58:19,178
Cooper we're coming, do not talk!

1287
01:58:19,251 --> 01:58:21,762
Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!

1288
01:58:24,774 --> 01:58:27,244
There is a security lockout sir, it requires...

1289
01:58:27,326 --> 01:58:30,017
...a person to access the functions.

1290
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:37,784
All yours sir.

1291
01:58:44,523 --> 01:58:49,049
Getting harder to breathe.

1292
01:58:49,161 --> 01:58:54,056
We are almost there!

1293
01:58:54,163 --> 01:58:55,082
Cooper!!

1294
01:58:58,788 --> 01:59:01,163
Come on.

1295
01:59:07,387 --> 01:59:11,816
I see him! I see him!
To the right.

1296
01:59:29,848 --> 01:59:33,107
Cooper!
Cooper, I'm here.

1297
01:59:38,653 --> 01:59:39,672
Take this!

1298
01:59:47,514 --> 01:59:49,203
Joey bring the tankers!

1299
01:59:55,785 --> 01:59:58,122
This data makes no sense.

1300
02:00:05,742 --> 02:00:09,275
I'm sorry.
-What?

1301
02:00:09,390 --> 02:00:11,233
Mann, was lying!

1302
02:00:21,014 --> 02:00:23,927
Romilly!

1303
02:00:24,036 --> 02:00:27,324
Romilly, do you read me?
Romilly!!

1304
02:00:27,433 --> 02:00:29,207
STEP BACK PROFESSOR!!

1305
02:00:36,572 --> 02:00:39,849
Romilly. -Romilly! Are you listening?

1306
02:00:42,203 --> 02:00:43,821
Keep watch!

1307
02:00:44,973 --> 02:00:48,598
Lois!
-What happened to caution CASE?

1308
02:00:48,676 --> 02:00:50,041
Safety first Cooper.

1309
02:00:50,119 --> 02:00:53,860
Romilly, Romilly do you read me?

1310
02:00:56,627 --> 02:01:00,680
Romilly!
-Dr. Brand, Cooper, there's been an explosion.

1311
02:01:00,794 --> 02:01:02,728
Dr. Mann's compound.

1312
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,562
TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock.

1313
02:01:39,045 --> 02:01:41,006
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

1314
02:01:44,571 --> 02:01:46,336
Romilly did not survive.

1315
02:01:47,563 --> 02:01:51,448
I could not save him.
-TARS is in. I'll take it from here!

1316
02:01:51,559 --> 02:01:53,945
D'you have a fix on the Ranger?
-He is pushing into orbit.

1317
02:01:54,058 --> 02:01:57,272
Ah, if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

1318
02:01:58,503 --> 02:02:01,751
He'd maroon us?
-He is marooning us!

1319
02:02:03,084 --> 02:02:06,677
Go downstairs. Wait for a while.

1320
02:02:13,397 --> 02:02:17,277
Let's go.
Get in the back!

1321
02:02:17,346 --> 02:02:18,358
Come on fast!

1322
02:02:23,537 --> 02:02:28,222
Dr. Mann please respond!
Dr. Mann please respond!!

1323
02:02:28,336 --> 02:02:32,333
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure.
-But the autopilot does.

1324
02:02:32,446 --> 02:02:36,220
Not since TARS disbled it!
-Nice!

1325
02:02:36,293 --> 02:02:39,104
What is your trust setting TARS?
-Lower than yours apparently!

1326
02:02:43,955 --> 02:02:47,024
Do not attempt docking, I repeat do not attempt docking.

1327
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:49,111
Auto docking sequence withheld.

1328
02:03:49,148 --> 02:03:53,461
Override. -Unauthorized.
-Override!

1329
02:03:53,537 --> 02:03:55,665
Unauthorized.

1330
02:04:00,076 --> 02:04:04,717
Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not! attempt docking! Please resp...

1331
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:50,163
Moving slowly towards the Endurance.

1332
02:05:14,451 --> 02:05:18,791
Imperfect contact.
-Override! -Hatch locked.

1333
02:05:26,230 --> 02:05:28,649
Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.

1334
02:05:30,683 --> 02:05:32,368
Dr. Mann...

1335
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:55,978
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1336
02:06:04,899 --> 02:06:08,785
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1337
02:06:08,858 --> 02:06:13,628
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open the hatch, the airlock will be depressurized.

1338
02:06:39,072 --> 02:06:42,087
What if he blows the airlock?
-Nothing good.

1339
02:06:47,841 --> 02:06:52,128
Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters full CASE.
-Maximum. -Back.

1340
02:06:52,381 --> 02:06:55,151
CASE conveys my message
to the onboard computer...

1341
02:06:55,265 --> 02:06:56,769
...and have it broadcast
through the emergency PA.

1342
02:06:56,804 --> 02:07:02,687
Dr. Mann, do not open the air hatch.

1343
02:07:02,796 --> 02:07:05,098
I repeat, do not open the air hatch. -Brand?

1344
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:10,141
I don't know what he said to you?
But I'm taking command of the Endurance.

1345
02:07:10,217 --> 02:07:12,993
And then we talk about completing the mission.

1346
02:07:15,512 --> 02:07:18,352
Dr. Mann, listen to me!

1347
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:22,315
This is not about my life, or Cooper's life,

1348
02:07:22,422 --> 02:07:24,194
This is about all mankind.

1349
02:07:25,283 --> 02:07:26,313
There is a moment...

1350
02:07:33,081 --> 02:07:34,121
It's not...

1351
02:07:42,259 --> 02:07:43,945
Oh, my God.

1352
02:08:01,853 --> 02:08:07,597
Cooper there's no point in using your fuel...
-Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1353
02:08:11,674 --> 02:08:14,481
-Cooper, what are you doing?
-Docking.

1354
02:08:17,353 --> 02:08:20,530
Computer says rotation at 67, 68 rpm.

1355
02:08:20,603 --> 02:08:24,747
Get ready to match our turn with retro thrusters.
-It's not possible.

1356
02:08:24,829 --> 02:08:26,875
-No, it's necessary.

1357
02:08:37,953 --> 02:08:40,651
The Endurance is entering the stratosphere.

1358
02:08:44,879 --> 02:08:46,503
It does not have a heat shield.

1359
02:08:48,953 --> 02:08:51,610
CASE, you ready?
-Ready.

1360
02:08:59,979 --> 02:09:02,798
Cooper, this is no time for caution.

1361
02:09:04,565 --> 02:09:06,581
CASE, if I faint, you take the stick.

1362
02:09:06,693 --> 02:09:10,182
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1363
02:09:16,571 --> 02:09:20,011
The Endurance is starting to heat.
-20 feet out.

1364
02:09:20,093 --> 02:09:23,940
I need three degrees to starboard Cooper.
-10 feet out.

1365
02:09:24,049 --> 02:09:27,581
Cooper, we are, lined up!

1366
02:09:27,697 --> 02:09:29,093
Start the spin!

1367
02:10:10,997 --> 02:10:12,286
Hold on TARS!

1368
02:10:20,099 --> 02:10:21,390
HOLD ON!

1369
02:10:31,858 --> 02:10:35,323
We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!

1370
02:10:42,567 --> 02:10:44,665
Slowly.

1371
02:10:45,692 --> 02:10:46,945
Slowly.

1372
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:54,160
Retro thrusters!

1373
02:11:01,663 --> 02:11:03,948
Main engines on!

1374
02:11:09,061 --> 02:11:12,545
We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!

1375
02:11:20,121 --> 02:11:21,747
Shutting engines.

1376
02:11:22,825 --> 02:11:24,813
Okay we're out of orbit!

1377
02:11:32,379 --> 02:11:35,616
OKay! And for our next trick!

1378
02:11:36,554 --> 02:11:40,703
It better be good.
We're headed into Gargantua's pull.

1379
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:45,213
Shit. CASE take the stick.
-Roger that.

1380
02:12:34,345 --> 02:12:37,253
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1381
02:12:37,401 --> 02:12:39,924
Shall I use the engines?

1382
02:12:40,036 --> 02:12:44,348
No, we gotta let her slide as much as we can!

1383
02:12:53,609 --> 02:12:56,433
Tell me.
-I have good news and bad news.

1384
02:12:56,543 --> 02:13:00,433
Yeah, throw them both TARS.

1385
02:13:08,067 --> 02:13:12,104
The back-up generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1386
02:13:13,274 --> 02:13:17,491
Okay.
The navigational hub is completely destroyed.

1387
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:20,216
We don't have enough life to make it back to Earth,

1388
02:13:20,291 --> 02:13:24,229
but I think we can scratch over to Edmond's planet.
-What about fuel?

1389
02:13:24,339 --> 02:13:27,042
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

1390
02:13:27,081 --> 02:13:30,595
We let, Gargantua, pull us down close...

1391
02:13:30,598 --> 02:13:33,729
to the horizon, and a powered slingshot...

1392
02:13:33,848 --> 02:13:36,503
...launching us towards Edmond's planet.
-Manually?

1393
02:13:36,615 --> 02:13:40,282
That's what I'm here for.
I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.

1394
02:13:40,357 --> 02:13:41,865
What about the time slippage?

1395
02:13:41,979 --> 02:13:45,472
Neither one of us has time
to think about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

1396
02:13:50,075 --> 02:13:51,063
Sorry Cooper.

1397
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:56,330
Once we have gathered enough speed...

1398
02:13:56,402 --> 02:13:59,454
...around Gargantua,
we use Lander 1,

1399
02:13:59,953 --> 02:14:02,590
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...

1400
02:14:02,847 --> 02:14:05,512
...to push us out of the black hole's gravity

1401
02:14:07,064 --> 02:14:09,904
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed,

1402
02:14:09,981 --> 02:14:12,970
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

1403
02:14:14,447 --> 02:14:17,725
Once Lander 1 has spent all it's fuel,
TARS will detach...

1404
02:14:17,834 --> 02:14:22,052
...and get sucked right into that black hole!
-Why does TARS have to detach?

1405
02:14:22,163 --> 02:14:26,651
We have to shed the weight, escape gravity.
-Newton's third law.

1406
02:14:26,727 --> 02:14:30,603
The only way humans have figured of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.

1407
02:14:30,759 --> 02:14:35,661
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
-He's a robot...

1408
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:39,871
...so I don't have to ask him to do anything.
-Cooper, you asshole!

1409
02:14:39,943 --> 02:14:44,320
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
-It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

1410
02:14:44,337 --> 02:14:47,287
It's our only chance to save people on Earth,

1411
02:14:47,364 --> 02:14:52,126
if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there,
maybe they'll make it.

1412
02:14:53,714 --> 02:14:56,051
Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.

1413
02:15:24,609 --> 02:15:26,460
Maximum velocity achieved.

1414
02:15:26,536 --> 02:15:31,376
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

1415
02:15:31,449 --> 02:15:33,985
Ready?
-Ready.

1416
02:15:34,071 --> 02:15:40,286
Firing the ignition in 3, 2, 1...

1417
02:15:55,974 --> 02:15:58,072
Engines on Lander 1 on my command,

1418
02:15:58,983 --> 02:16:03,928
3, 2, 1...

1419
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:11,321
Engines of Ranger 2 on my command,

1420
02:16:11,395 --> 02:16:15,956
3, 2, 1...

1421
02:16:25,179 --> 02:16:29,136
This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years!!

1422
02:16:29,214 --> 02:16:32,528
You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!

1423
02:16:47,641 --> 02:16:50,815
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark,

1424
02:16:50,925 --> 02:16:56,748
3, 2, 1...

1425
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:57,874
Detach!

1426
02:17:00,779 --> 02:17:05,347
Goodbye TARS!
-Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.

1427
02:17:05,424 --> 02:17:06,768
See you there slick!

1428
02:17:15,301 --> 02:17:18,754
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

1429
02:17:18,869 --> 02:17:21,333
Learned from the master!

1430
02:17:21,414 --> 02:17:23,921
Ranger 2, prepare for detachment.

1431
02:17:24,004 --> 02:17:27,683
-What, no, no! Cooper, Cooper,
what are you doing??

1432
02:17:27,791 --> 02:17:31,060
Newton's third law.
You gotta leave something behind!

1433
02:17:31,429 --> 02:17:35,838
You said we had enough resources for both of us!
-We agreed Amelia,

1434
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:38,405
90%

1435
02:17:38,518 --> 02:17:40,680
No!

1436
02:17:41,959 --> 02:17:44,130
Detach.

1437
02:17:57,513 --> 02:17:59,939
Okay, we're nosing down.

1438
02:18:03,419 --> 02:18:05,650
Approaching the event horizon.

1439
02:18:06,843 --> 02:18:18,948
Portside, dipping down beneath it. Going through it.
Heading towards it. Blackness....

1440
02:18:19,172 --> 02:18:21,044
It's all black!

1441
02:18:23,385 --> 02:18:27,463
TARS, do you read me? It's all black.

1442
02:18:28,261 --> 02:18:31,122
TARS, do you read me? Over.

1443
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:42,070
We're...we're getting,
we're getting interference.

1444
02:18:43,914 --> 02:18:45,177
Losing control of the stick.

1445
02:18:45,281 --> 02:18:49,204
We've got flashes.
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1446
02:18:49,279 --> 02:18:53,983
There's a turbulence in the gravity.

1447
02:18:58,666 --> 02:19:01,586
computers going down.

1448
02:19:13,227 --> 02:19:16,459
The gravitational pull, we're losing control of the stick.

1449
02:19:49,465 --> 02:19:51,623
Murph! Let's go!

1450
02:21:58,486 --> 02:21:59,568
Murph!

1451
02:22:09,975 --> 02:22:12,101
Murph!! Murphhh!!

1452
02:22:20,673 --> 02:22:21,049
Murph!!

1453
02:22:28,464 --> 02:22:31,664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!!!!!

1454
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,148
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

1455
02:22:34,155 --> 02:22:35,273
No, no!!!!!!!

1456
02:23:34,479 --> 02:23:38,435
If you're leaving just go!
-No.

1457
02:23:39,408 --> 02:23:43,163
No, don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!!!

1458
02:23:45,543 --> 02:23:51,987
Morse, morse, morse.

1459
02:23:52,107 --> 02:23:52,843
'S'

1460
02:23:59,074 --> 02:23:59,827
'T'

1461
02:24:03,102 --> 02:24:05,562
'A'

1462
02:24:06,408 --> 02:24:07,580
'-'

1463
02:24:09,464 --> 02:24:11,758
'-'

1464
02:24:12,550 --> 02:24:16,403
Murph, we don't have time for this, come on!

1465
02:24:22,302 --> 02:24:23,400
STAY!!!

1466
02:24:33,677 --> 02:24:44,271
Come on, come on, Murph, come on!
What's it say? What's it say? What's it say?

1467
02:24:51,477 --> 02:24:52,449
Stay.

1468
02:25:28,132 --> 02:25:30,883
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

1469
02:25:33,264 --> 02:25:36,069
Make him, make him stay Murph.

1470
02:25:40,351 --> 02:25:41,897
STAY

1471
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:46,595
Murph me stay Murph!

1472
02:25:47,822 --> 02:25:50,409
Don't let me leave Murph!!!

1473
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:56,456
Don't, DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!!!

1474
02:26:01,267 --> 02:26:03,720
NO, NO, NO, NOOO!!!.

1475
02:26:24,736 --> 02:26:26,427
It was you!!

1476
02:26:37,602 --> 02:26:40,087
You were my ghost!!

1477
02:26:51,697 --> 02:26:55,450
Cooper, Cooper come in.
-TARS??

1478
02:26:55,607 --> 02:26:57,041
Roger that.

1479
02:26:58,414 --> 02:27:01,608
You survived?
-Somewhere...

1480
02:27:01,725 --> 02:27:05,935
...in their fifth dimension.
They saved us!

1481
02:27:06,052 --> 02:27:09,576
Yeah? Well who the hell is 'They'?

1482
02:27:09,687 --> 02:27:11,813
And just why would they want to help us?

1483
02:27:11,894 --> 02:27:14,979
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1484
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:19,716
...inside their five dimensional
reality to allow you to understand it.
-Yeah well it ain't working.

1485
02:27:19,792 --> 02:27:25,909
Yes it is. You see that time,
is represented as a physical dimension.

1486
02:27:26,029 --> 02:27:30,585
You've worked out that you can exert a force
across spacetime.
-Gravity...

1487
02:27:31,629 --> 02:27:34,246
...to send a message?
-Affirmative.

1488
02:27:36,187 --> 02:27:38,157
Gravity...

1489
02:27:38,273 --> 02:27:42,731
...can cross the dimensions, including time?

1490
02:27:43,006 --> 02:27:44,268
Exactly.

1491
02:27:48,056 --> 02:27:51,974
Do you have the quantum data?
-Roger, I have it.

1492
02:27:52,084 --> 02:27:55,421
I've been transferring it on all wavelengths...

1493
02:27:55,422 --> 02:27:59,583
...but nothing is getting out Cooper.
-I can do this, I can.

1494
02:27:59,632 --> 02:28:04,266
But such complicated data to a child?
-Not just any child.

1495
02:28:06,106 --> 02:28:07,937
Come on dad!

1496
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:12,736
Murph, the fire's out! come on!

1497
02:28:12,807 --> 02:28:16,498
Even though you communicate it here,
she won't understand it's significance for years!

1498
02:28:16,661 --> 02:28:21,530
No, no, I get that TARS, but
we've got to figure out something...

1499
02:28:21,642 --> 02:28:24,273
...or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think, think, think!

1500
02:28:24,546 --> 02:28:28,152
Cooper, they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

1501
02:28:31,818 --> 02:28:36,717
Say that again.
-They didn't bring us here, to change the past.

1502
02:28:40,929 --> 02:28:43,737
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1503
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:49,812
We brought ourselves!

1504
02:28:58,975 --> 02:29:03,385
TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA, in binary.

1505
02:29:03,512 --> 02:29:05,843
In binary, roger, translating data.

1506
02:29:29,544 --> 02:29:32,316
It's not a ghost.

1507
02:29:33,254 --> 02:29:37,761
It's gravity.
-Don't you get it yet TARS?

1508
02:29:37,874 --> 02:29:39,714
I brought myself here!

1509
02:29:40,211 --> 02:29:44,161
We're here to communicate,
with the three dimensional world!

1510
02:29:44,698 --> 02:29:45,998
We are the bridge!

1511
02:29:53,177 --> 02:29:56,272
I thought they chose me.

1512
02:29:58,900 --> 02:30:02,908
But they didn't choose me, they chose her!
-To do what Cooper?

1513
02:30:05,402 --> 02:30:07,021
To save the world!

1514
02:30:11,058 --> 02:30:15,185
All of this! In one, little girl's bedroom.

1515
02:30:15,297 --> 02:30:17,719
Every moment, is infinitely complex.

1516
02:30:17,826 --> 02:30:20,819
They have access to infinite time and space...

1517
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:22,448
...but they're not bound by anything!

1518
02:30:22,577 --> 02:30:27,327
They can't find, a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1519
02:30:27,443 --> 02:30:31,100
That's why I'm here.
-I'm here to find a way...

1520
02:30:31,124 --> 02:30:34,256
...to tell Murph,
just like I found this moment.
-How Cooper?

1521
02:30:34,372 --> 02:30:35,928
Love TARS, love!

1522
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:39,634
It's just like Brand said,
my connection with Murph, it is quantifiable.

1523
02:30:39,742 --> 02:30:42,245
It is the key. -Why are we here?

1524
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:45,342
To find out how to tell.

1525
02:30:47,859 --> 02:30:49,621
The watch!

1526
02:30:52,655 --> 02:30:56,319
The watch!

1527
02:30:58,555 --> 02:31:01,714
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

1528
02:31:05,139 --> 02:31:09,135
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and give it to me.

1529
02:31:09,208 --> 02:31:12,565
Translating the data to Morse.
Cooper, What if she never came back for it?

1530
02:31:13,903 --> 02:31:17,533
She will. She will.

1531
02:31:19,153 --> 02:31:22,935
He's coming Murph!

1532
02:31:24,052 --> 02:31:29,030
Okay, coming down!
-How do you know?

1533
02:31:32,489 --> 02:31:34,255
Because I gave it to her!

1534
02:31:38,902 --> 02:31:42,360
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,

1535
02:31:45,206 --> 02:31:50,093
Dot, dot, dash, dot,

1536
02:31:50,168 --> 02:31:52,405
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1537
02:31:52,481 --> 02:31:57,161
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1538
02:32:17,073 --> 02:32:20,995
It was him!!

1539
02:32:21,108 --> 02:32:24,418
All the time!!
I knew it!!!

1540
02:32:24,504 --> 02:32:26,687
Dad saved us!!

1541
02:33:09,946 --> 02:33:12,570
Eureka!!!

1542
02:33:15,022 --> 02:33:16,930
It's traditional.

1543
02:33:21,042 --> 02:33:22,805
Eureka!!!

1544
02:33:27,559 --> 02:33:30,955
Did it work?
-I think it might have.

1545
02:33:32,325 --> 02:33:33,981
How do you know?

1546
02:33:34,061 --> 02:33:37,505
Because, the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

1547
02:33:41,333 --> 02:33:43,345
Don't you get it yet TARS?

1548
02:33:43,418 --> 02:33:46,729
They're not beings.

1549
02:33:46,805 --> 02:33:48,495
They're us!

1550
02:33:50,009 --> 02:33:53,781
What I've been doing for Murph,
they've been doing for me!

1551
02:33:53,896 --> 02:33:57,775
For all of us.
-Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1552
02:33:57,851 --> 02:34:02,388
No, no. Not yet. But one day.

1553
02:34:02,539 --> 02:34:06,416
Not you and me. But people.

1554
02:34:06,488 --> 02:34:12,138
A civilization that's evolved
past the 4 dimensions that we know.

1555
02:34:17,693 --> 02:34:18,805
What happens now?

1556
02:35:21,773 --> 02:35:22,638
Mr. Cooper.

1557
02:35:27,281 --> 02:35:31,069
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

1558
02:35:31,181 --> 02:35:33,949
Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.

1559
02:35:34,059 --> 02:35:36,502
Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.

1560
02:35:43,539 --> 02:35:45,155
Take it slow sir.

1561
02:35:46,614 --> 02:35:48,128
You were, um, extremely lucky.

1562
02:35:48,236 --> 02:35:52,513
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1563
02:36:04,516 --> 02:36:07,290
Where am I?

1564
02:36:09,204 --> 02:36:10,787
Cooper station.

1565
02:36:12,050 --> 02:36:13,713
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1566
02:36:14,947 --> 02:36:17,690
Cooper station?

1567
02:36:20,448 --> 02:36:22,887
Well it's nice of you to name it after me!

1568
02:36:25,942 --> 02:36:29,526
What?
-Well, the station isn't named after you sir,

1569
02:36:29,640 --> 02:36:31,034
It's uh, it's named after your daughter.

1570
02:36:31,115 --> 02:36:35,539
Although she's always maintained
how important you were.
-Is she still alive?

1571
02:36:35,613 --> 02:36:39,477
She'll be here in a couple of weeks.

1572
02:36:40,567 --> 02:36:43,817
She is far too old to be
transferred from another station...

1573
02:36:43,891 --> 02:36:46,122
...but when she heard that you'd been found.

1574
02:36:46,229 --> 02:36:49,756
Well this is, well this is
Murphy Cooper we're talking about!

1575
02:36:49,867 --> 02:36:51,741
Yes it is!

1576
02:36:54,222 --> 02:36:56,244
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple of days.

1577
02:36:59,301 --> 02:37:01,869
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.

1578
02:37:02,522 --> 02:37:07,396
I actually, did a paper on you,
in uhh...high school,

1579
02:37:07,504 --> 02:37:09,132
I kinda knew all about you, back then.

1580
02:37:10,931 --> 02:37:13,632
Oh yeah, right.

1581
02:37:15,004 --> 02:37:21,365
Sir, if you could follow me?
You've got a really good situation.

1582
02:37:25,147 --> 02:37:28,537
So um, when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

1583
02:37:29,873 --> 02:37:32,817
I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.

1584
02:37:39,438 --> 02:37:43,200
Well of course, I didn't speak to her in person.

1585
02:37:47,429 --> 02:37:52,313
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1586
02:37:52,422 --> 02:37:55,641
Anyway, there just wasn't enough food.

1587
02:37:55,753 --> 02:38:01,727
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

1588
02:38:02,021 --> 02:38:04,284
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1589
02:38:12,025 --> 02:38:14,677
She did confirm, just how much you loved farming.

1590
02:38:14,758 --> 02:38:17,141
She did? Did she?

1591
02:38:17,215 --> 02:38:20,529
Well, home sweet home!

1592
02:38:20,601 --> 02:38:24,229
Everything is in its place and
faithfully reproduced.

1593
02:38:24,310 --> 02:38:25,695
Yes.

1594
02:38:30,244 --> 02:38:35,517
Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine
we found out near Saturn with you.

1595
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:38,994
It's power source is shot,
but we can get another one if you want.

1596
02:38:39,103 --> 02:38:40,863
Yes, please!

1597
02:38:42,126 --> 02:38:42,908
Settings.

1598
02:38:44,105 --> 02:38:45,053
General settings.

1599
02:38:46,097 --> 02:38:47,280
Security settings.

1600
02:38:49,408 --> 02:38:52,423
Honesty, new setting.

1601
02:38:53,658 --> 02:38:58,518
95%
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1602
02:38:58,592 --> 02:39:03,272
Humor: 75%

1603
02:39:03,382 --> 02:39:04,935
Confirmed.

1604
02:39:05,046 --> 02:39:09,053
Auto self destruct in T minus 10,9...

1605
02:39:09,158 --> 02:39:10,740
Let's make that 60%.

1606
02:39:12,514 --> 02:39:15,317
60% confirmed.

1607
02:39:15,390 --> 02:39:19,138
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

1608
02:39:23,503 --> 02:39:25,503
Is this really what it was like?

1609
02:39:27,845 --> 02:39:30,549
It was never this clean slick.

1610
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:39,793
I don't care much for this, pretending
we are back where we started.

1611
02:39:40,622 --> 02:39:42,853
I want to know where we are?

1612
02:39:43,978 --> 02:39:46,309
Where are we going?

1613
02:39:51,183 --> 02:39:53,645
Mr Cooper. -Yes?
-The family is all in there.

1614
02:39:53,802 --> 02:39:55,433
Family?

1615
02:39:55,544 --> 02:39:59,392
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

1616
02:40:32,034 --> 02:40:34,800
You told them I liked farming?

1617
02:40:40,241 --> 02:40:41,393
It was me Murph!

1618
02:40:43,839 --> 02:40:46,250
I was your ghost!

1619
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:48,774
I know.

1620
02:40:50,901 --> 02:40:56,545
People didn't believe me,
they thought I was doing it all by myself. But...

1621
02:40:59,721 --> 02:41:02,134
...I knew it was you.

1622
02:41:06,277 --> 02:41:08,368
Nobody believed me.

1623
02:41:08,487 --> 02:41:11,431
But I knew you'd come back.

1624
02:41:13,234 --> 02:41:14,849
How?

1625
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:20,150
Because my dad promised me!

1626
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:30,642
I'm here now Murph.
I'm here!

1627
02:41:32,450 --> 02:41:39,894
No. No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

1628
02:41:42,028 --> 02:41:46,166
I have my kids here for me now.

1629
02:41:48,436 --> 02:41:50,505
You go!

1630
02:41:53,058 --> 02:41:53,994
Where?

1631
02:41:57,352 --> 02:41:59,479
Brand.

1632
02:42:08,505 --> 02:42:11,299
She's, out there.

1633
02:42:15,863 --> 02:42:18,829
Setting up camp.

1634
02:42:45,381 --> 02:42:50,814
Alone, in a strange galaxy.

1635
02:43:01,554 --> 02:43:05,023
Maybe right now she's, settling in...

1636
02:43:05,058 --> 02:43:07,378
...for the long nap.

1637
02:43:23,324 --> 02:43:27,753
By the light of our new sun.

1638
02:43:42,669 --> 02:43:45,369
In our new home.

1639
02:43:46,305 --> 02:44:46,808
