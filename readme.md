1. Use and understand **Git!**
2. **UML** at least **3** good diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all tools to view them!

- [Deployment Diagram](UML/deployment_diagram.svg)

4. **DDD** If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 10 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with 5-0 Domains. It would be nice if these domains are derived from an Event-Storming (but not mandatory). 
5. **Metrics** at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non trivial metrics are also fine.
6. **Clean Code Development:** at least **5** points you can show me + >>10 points on your **personal cheat sheet**
7. **Build Management** with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc.
8. Integrate some nice **Unit-Tests** in your Code to be integrated into the Build
9. **Continuous Delivery:** show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc.
10. Use a good **IDE** and get fluent with it as e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favorite **Key-Shortcuts**?!
11. **DSL** Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project
12. **Functional Programming** (prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as
  - only final data structures
  - (mostly) side effect free functions
  - the use of higher-order functions
  - functions as parameters and return values
  - use closures / anonymous functions
